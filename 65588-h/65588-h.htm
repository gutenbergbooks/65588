</div>

<p>Alexander Leacraft was regarding with as much
interest as his constitutional lassitude permitted,
the progress of a distinctly audible altercation on
Pennsylvania avenue, Washington, D. C. The disputants
had not felt it necessary, under the relaxing
influences of a premature spring, to interpose
any screen of secrecy, such as a less exposed position,
or subdued voices, between themselves and
the news-mongering (and hungering, let it be added)
proletariat of our nation’s capital.</p>

<p>A small crowd, composed of the singular human
compound always pervasive and never to be avoided
in Washington, which, in that centre of political
sensations, is made up of street loafers, accidental
tourists, perambulating babies, “niggers,” and
presumptive statesmen, enclosed this “argument”;
and from his elevated station, within the front parlor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of the McKinley, Mr. Leacraft was afforded a
very excellent view of and an equally distinct hearing
of the disagreement and its principals.</p>

<p>The two disputants were themselves sufficiently
contrasted in appearance to have allured the casual
passer-by to observe their contrasted methods
in debate. One—the taller—was a thin, angular
man with unnaturally long arms, a peculiar swaying
habit of body, an elongated visage, terminating
in a short, stubby growth of whiskers, and a sharp,
crackling kind of voice, with unmistakable nasal
faults. He seemed to be a southern man modified
by a few imitations of the northern type.</p>

<p>He was addressing a bulky, rather disdainful
man in a checquered suit of clothes, who had advanced
the season’s fashion by assuming a straw
hat, and whose rosy face, broad and typical features,
and yet not plethoric expansion of body,
strong and stalwart frame betokened much animal
force, and reserved power of action. He might
have been a northern man. As Alexander Leacraft
looked at them, it was the southern man who
was speaking, and his uplifted arm, at regular intervals,
rose and fell, as the palms of both hands
met in a cadence of corroborative whacks. It may
interest the reader to know that the particular time
of this particular incident was April, 1909.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you this, Mr. Tompkins,” drawled
the southerner with loquacious ease, the crackle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
sharpness of his intonation appearing as his excitement
increased, “the necessities of our states
demand the Canal at whatever cost. It will be
the avenue for an export trade to the east, which
will convert our stored powers of production into
gold, and it will react upon the whole country north
and south in a way that will make all previous
prosperity look like nothing. Our cotton mills
have grown, our mineral resources have been developed;
Georgia and Alabama are to-day competing
with your shaft furnaces and steel mills for the
trade of the railroads, and builders; and for that
matter we are building ourselves. We can support
a population ten times all we have to-day; our resources
have been just broached, but exhaustion is
a thousand years away. Our rival has been Cuba.
She has robbed us of trade; she has put our sugar
plantations out of business; even her iron, which I
will admit is superior in quality, has scaled our
profits on raw ingots, but she can’t hold us down
on cotton. Open up this canal, and we will gather
the riches of the Orient; our ships will fill it with
unbroken processions, and in the train of that commerce
in cotton, every section of the Union will
furnish its contribution to swell the argosies of
trade. I tell you sir” and the excited speaker, conscious
of an admiring sympathy in the crowd
around him, raised his voice into a musical shout,
in which the crackle was quite lost, “the commerce,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
the mercantile integrity of these United States will
be restored, and American bottoms for American
goods will be no longer a vain aspiration; it will
be a realized dream, an actual fact.”</p>

<p>He paused, as if the projectile force of
his words had deprived him of breath, and then
at the momentary opportunity Mr. Tompkins, in a
clear and metallic voice, with a punctuative force
of occasional hesitation, undertook his friend’s
refutation.</p>

<p>“I’m not contesting the fact, Mr. Snowden,” he
said, “that the opening of the Canal means a good
deal to your portion of the country. Does it mean
as much to the rest of the country, and does it mean
so much to you for a long time. You mention cotton.
Do you know that the cotton cultivation of
India and Egypt has increased enormously, and
that it is grown with cheaper labor than you can
command. You have made the negro acquainted
with his value. You have raised his expectations,
you have thrust him into a hundred avenues of occupation
and every one of his new avocations adds
a shilling a day to the worth per man of the remainder,
who stick to field work and cultivate your
cotton fields. The cotton of Egypt and the cotton
of India, I mean its manufactured forms, will go
through that canal to Asia and Japan and Polynesia
just as surely as yours will, and it’ll go
cheaper. It is poorer cotton, I know, but that will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
not effect the result.</p>

<p>“That isn’t all. Brazil and the Argentine Republic
are growing cotton, and they are doing well
at it. Europe will take the raw stuff from them
and keep up her present predominance in that market
while she turns their cotton bolls into satinettes
and ginghams for the almond-eyes of Asia. The
canal, breaking down a barrier of separation between
the two oceans, turns loose into the Pacific
the whole frenzied, greedy and capable cohorts of
European manufacture. It will make a common
highway for Europe, and our unbuilt clippers and
tramp steamers will stay unbuilt, or unused, to rot
on their ways in the shipyards. The west coast will
be sidetracked, and our trunk railroads will cut
down their schedules and their dividends at the
same time. Roosevelt put this canal through, and
your southern votes helped to elect him against his
protest, but brought to it by an overwhelming
public sentiment that applauded his power to chain
or sterilize trusts; and he promised last March to
your southern rooters, at his inauguration, to see
that before his present new term was over, before
1913, the canal would be opened, and perhaps he’ll
make good.</p>

<p>“You southerners elected Roosevelt, and you
have killed the Democratic party. The new powers
of growth of that party were most likely to develop
among you, but you shoved aside the proffered offer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of political supremacy, because you too had surrendered
to the idols of Mammon, and were willing
to sell your birth-right for a mess of pottage.
Well! You’ve got the canal and you’ve got Roosevelt,
and let me tell you Mr. Snowden,” and the restrained,
almost nonchalant demeanor of Mr.
Tompkins became suddenly charged with electric
earnestness, “you’ll get Hell, too.”</p>

<p>This admonitory expletive, uttered with a force
that seemed to impart to it a physical objectivity,
caused the increasing circle of auditors to retreat
sensibly, and, without more consideration, giving a
glance of mute scorn at the flushed face of the
southerner, the speaker pressed his way through
the little crowd, which, after a moment’s suspension
of judgment, seemed reluctant to let him escape,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>His opponent was distinctly chagrined. The
wrinkled lines about his peculiarly pleasant eyes,
indicated his strained attention, and were not altogether
unrelated to a sudden muscular movement
in his clenched hands. His hopes, however, for some
sort of forensic gratification might have been sensibly
raised as he discovered himself the sole occupant
of the small vacant spot on the side walk,
walled in by a human investiture, the first line of
which was made up of two pickaninnies, three
newsboys, one rueful cur and some impromptu
mothers who had taken the family babies out for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
air and recreation, but, overcome by the indigenous
love of debate, had forgotten their mission, and
held their charges in various attitudes of somnolence
or furtive rebellion against the hedge of men
behind them.</p>

<p>It was evidently expected that the southern gentleman
would relieve his feelings, and it was also
evident from a few ejaculations hap-hazardly emitted
from the concourse, that the majority of those
present was in his favor.</p>

<p>Mr. Snowden looked around him reflectively,
and a sense of personal dignity forced its way
against the almost over-powering impulse to appeal
to popular approval, and convinced him that
the place and the audience were inopportune for
any further discussion. He could not, however,
escape the demonstrated force of popular expectancy,
and, with a consenting smile, a shrug
of his shoulders, and with his hat raised above his
head, swinging gently, he called out “Three cheers
for Teddy and the Canal.”</p>

<p>In an instant the group seized the invitation, and
under the cover, if it may be so violently symbolized,
of the cloud of vocality, his enthusiasm evoked,
Mr. Snowden, like the fortuitous and directive
deities of the epics, vanished.</p>

<p>There remained an unsatisfied group to which
more accessions were quickly made, the whole
movement evidently animated by some emotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
then predominant in the national capital. This
group broke up into little knots of talkers, and as
the day was closing, no urgency of business engagements
and no immediate insistency of domestic
duties interfered with the easily elicited Washingtonian
tendency to settle, on the public curb,
the vexed questions of state, if not to enlighten
Providence on the more abstruse functions of His
authority.</p>

<p>Alexander Leacraft willingly surrendered himself
to the study of this representative public
<em>Althing</em>, and felt his exasperating torpor so much
overcome by a new curiosity as to make him not
averse to stepping out into the hall of the hotel,
descending the steps into the street, and engaging
himself in the capacity of a rotational listener at
the various groups, sometimes not exceeding two
men, who had become vocally animated, and felt
themselves called upon to supply the deficiency
of objurgation, so disagreeably emphasized by the
sudden departure of the northern and southern disputants.</p>

<p>The illuminative results of his ambulatory inspection,
and his own expostulations or inquiry,
may be thus succinctly summarized.</p>

<p>Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, elected in his own behalf
in 1905, as president of the United States, after
having served out the unexpired term of William
McKinley, who was assassinated in November,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
1901, and with whom he had been elected as
vice president, had been again re-elected in the fall
of 1908, against his emphatic rejection, at first, of
a joint nomination of the Republican and Democratic
parties. The campaign, if campaign it could
be called, had been one of the most extraordinary
ever recorded, and in its features of popular clamor,
the grotesque conflict of the personal repugnance
of an unwilling candidate nominated against
his will, and in defiance of his own repeated inhibitions
to nominate him at all, because of his solemn
promise that he would defer to the unwritten law of
the country, and not serve a third term, was altogether
unprecedented, and to some observers ominous.
He was reminded that his first term, although
practically four years, was still only an
accident, that there was no subversion of the unwritten
law, in his serving again, as his actual
election as president had occurred but once, that
his popularity among the people was of such an
intense, almost self-devouring ardor, that it was
an act of suicidal negation, of unpatriotic desertion
to shun or reject the people’s obvious need, that a
war, yet unfinished, had been begun by him against
corporate interests, that its logical continuance
devolved upon him, that the unique occasion of a
unanimous nomination to the presidency carried
with it a sublime primacy of interest, that cancelled
all previous conditions, promises or wishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
on his part, and laid an imperious command upon
its subject that deprived him of volition, and absolutely
dissolved into nothingness any apparent contradiction
of his words and acts. Finally, it was
insisted that the Panama Canal was nearing completion,
that its remarkable advance was due to
Mr. Roosevelt that this fact had been prepotent
in shaping the councils of southern Democrats in
proposing the, otherwise unwarranted, endorsement
of a Republican nomination, that a strong
minority sentiment had crystallized around an
angry group of capitalists who were only too anxious
to get rid of Roosevelt altogether, and that in
the case of his refusal, these men would so manipulate
the newspapers, and inflame public apprehension,
against some possible outbreak of social radicalism,
financial heresy, and anarchistic violence,
that a reaction begun would become unmanageable,
and some tool of the reactionaries, and the railroads,
would be swept into office, and with him a
servile Congress, and Roosevelt’s work, so aggressively
and successfully prosecuted, would be all
sacrificed. Nor was this all. The return to a divided
nomination, with an unmistakable intention
on the part of the conservatists to repeal all disadvantageous
legislation to the monopolies, corporations
and trusts, would at once precipitate a conflict
of classes.</p>

<p>A radical man, possibly a demagogue, would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
placed in opposition to the choice of the plutocracy.
His election was also not improbable. The powers
of socialism, enormously strengthened by the adhesion
of an educated class, might be triumphant,
and the succeeding steps in social revolution would
bring chaos.</p>

<p>This dilemma was so pertinaciously displayed, so
forcibly accentuated, that Roosevelt had yielded at
the last moment, not insensibly affected (as what
spirited man would not be) by the magnificent assemblies
(mass meetings) throughout the country,
tumultuously vociferating the call of the people.</p>

<p>The southern people, with characteristic warmth,
and through the suddenly consummated attachment
of Senator Tillman to Roosevelt, and under the
coercion of Senator Bailey’s logic and power of
argumentative persuasion, had swelled the tide of
popular approval. Roosevelt became an idol—his
election was almost unanimous, a handful only of
contestants having gathered in a kind of moral
protest around Governor Hughes as a rival candidate.
Governor Hughes’ nomination was achieved
through a combination of opposite political interests,
as anomalous as that which chose Roosevelt,
and having precisely the same quality of coherence.</p>

<p>It represented dissatisfied Republicans, an
alienable remnant of Democrats, and had drawn
into it a few sporadic political elements that barely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
sufficed to give it numerical significance. W. J. Bryan,
who would have been otherwise a candidate
himself, had endorsed Roosevelt, furnishing thereby
an example of political abnegation which had
enormously increased his popularity, and assured
him the nomination of Nationalists, as the new fusionists
were called, in 1913. This was also deemed
a wise forethought, as a provision against the possible
success of the rampant Hearstites. Hearst
would have been the socialist candidate in the last
campaign, had not the principal himself, on hearing
of Roosevelt’s nomination, sapiently withdrawn,
fearing defeat, which would have too seriously
discredited him in the next national struggle.</p>

<p>The Prohibitionists had, by an act of virtual self-repudiation,
thrown their not inconsiderable vote
to Roosevelt. The Socialists were the only important
opponents of his election, and their surprising
record made the prophetic warnings, which had
convinced Roosevelt of the necessity of his candidacy,
appear like a veritable intervention of Providence,
at least this was the language commonly used
with reference to it.</p>

<p>Roosevelt had displayed remarkable self-control
and consistent gravity, and had even, in a very extraordinary
address at his inauguration, deprecated
the unanimity of his election. He deplored the
precarious dilemma of a country which found itself
forced to do violence to its traditions in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
to escape an imagined danger.</p>

<p>Almost synchronous with his re-election, the announcement
had been made that the Panama Canal,
upon which the President in his former term, had
exerted the utmost pressure of his inexhaustible
enthusiasm, energy and exhortation, was advancing
very rapidly, engineering difficulties unexpectedly
had vanished, a system of extreme precision in the
control of the work, itself largely the device of the
President, had facilitated the entire operation, and
a promise of still more rapid progress was made.</p>

<p>This promise had produced a storm of southern
enthusiasm. The south, completely restored in its
financial autonomy, had been growing richer and
richer, and their public men had not hesitated to
paint, in the brightest colors, the further expansion
of their prosperity with the opening of this
avenue of commerce between the oceans, assuring
its people the markets of Asia, and their rapid promotion
to the political, social and financial primacy
in the United States.</p>

<p>Northern capitalists had not been incredulous
to these predictions, and in a group of railroad
magnates, whose interests seemed now seriously
threatened, a sullen resentment was maintained
against Roosevelt, in which the unmistakable notes
of designs almost criminal had been detected. Mr.
Tompkins, whose altercation with the southerner
had led Leacraft into this voyage of interpellation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
and discovery, was a paid agent, in the employ of
this cabal.</p>

<p>Alexander Leacraft was an Englishman, inheriting
an English temperament without English
prejudices; he was fortunately free from the worst
faults of that insular hesitancy which imparts the
curious impression of timidity, and had advanced
far enough in cosmopolitan observation to get rid
of the queerness of provincial ignorance. He was
indeed a sane and attractive man, and provided by
nature with a forcible physique, a good face, and
a really fascinating proclivity to make the best of
things, admire his companions, and bend unremittingly
to the pressure of his environment.</p>

<p>He had not escaped the dangers incident to
youth, and his heart had become attached to a lady
of Baltimore—one of the undeviatingly arch and
winning American girls—to whom he had been introduced
by her brother, a commercial correspondent.</p>

<p>The nature of his affairs—he was the secretary
of an English company which operated some copper
mines in Arizona and Canada—had made him
a frequent visitor to the shores of the New World,
and he had not been unwilling to express his hope
that the United States would become his final
home. These sentiments were quite honest, though
it might have elicited the cynical observation that
the capture of his affections by Miss Garrett had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
done more to weaken his loyalty to the crown than
any dispassionate admiration of a Republican form
of government. But the imputation would have
been malicious. Leacraft did feel an earnest admiration
for the American people, and yielded a
genial acquiescence to the claims of popular suffrage.
His connexion with America had been fortunate,
and he had come in contact with men and
women whose natures by endowment, and whose
manners and habits, conversation and tastes, by
inheritance and cultivation, were elevating and
engaging—men and women whose nobility of sympathy
with all things human was reflected in an art
of living not only always decorous and refined, but
guided, too, by the principles of urbanity and justice.</p>

<p>The Garretts of Baltimore were a widely connected,
and in numbers an imposing social element,
and none of the various daughters of light and
loveliness who bore that name more merited consideration
in the eyes of manly youth than the capricious,
captivating and elusive Sally. Her graces
of manner were not less delightful than her conversation
was spirited and roguish, and her assumption
of a demure simplicity had often driven Alexander
Leacraft to the limits of his English matter-of-fact
credulity in explaining to her the relations
of the King to Parliament, or the municipal acreage
of the old City of London. All of which information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
this very well read and much travelled
young woman, as might be expected, was possessed
of, but just for the purposes of her feminine and
cruel fancy, not too well disposed towards her patient
suitor, disingenuously concealed. Sally really
enjoyed the painstaking gravity with which the
young Englishman explained the eternal principles
of English rule, and the never-to-be-forgotten
superiorities of London.</p>

<p>Mr. Leacraft had met Sally under circumstances
the most provocative of admiration. In her own
home; where the sincerity of hospitality and the
urgency of an American’s deference to the best instincts
of courtesy, did not altogether mitigate her
coquetry and mirthful affectations, and even, by the
faintest gloss of repression, made them the more
delicious. The Englishman was bewitched, and his
infatuation declared itself so plainly that Sally—whose
heart was quite untouched by his distress—tried
the resources of her ingenuity to avoid meeting
him alone.</p>

<p>Leacraft, on the morrow of the day, whose close
had so deeply inducted him into a study of American
politics, expected to make a deferred visit to
the Garretts at Baltimore, and he had quite firmly
resolved that he would reveal his desperate extremity
to Sally, and plead his best to show her how
empty life would be to him without her, and that it
would be shockingly obdurate in her to decline to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
regard him as the goal of her marital ambitions.</p>

<p>He felt some fear of her revolting gayety, and his
fears were not assuaged by the remembrance of any
particular occasion when her conduct towards him
permitted him to indulge in hopes. Still the thing
must be done. His unrest must be quieted. To
know the worst was better than this feverish anxiety
of doubt. And besides, with a prudence not
altogether British, he thought he could endure repulse
better now than later, and in the event of that
evil alternative, he could cast about him for alleviating
resources which might be more easily found
now, than if he waited longer, and if he continued
to expose himself to the perilous encounter of her
eyes, and the tantalizing caresses of her wit.</p>

<p>When Leacraft returned to the hotel, he found
a letter waiting for him, which he saw at once was
from his friend, Ned Garrett. He tore it open and
discovered, to his considerable discomfiture, that
it postponed the event of his momentous proposal.</p>

<p>It read:</p>

<p class="p1">Dear Leacraft:</p>

<p>Aunt Sophia is very sick at Litchfield, Conn.
Mother and Sally have gone on. Can you put off
your visit until May, say the 28th? You will find
it dull here without Sally and Mother. I shall go
with them as far as New York. We all intend, if
Aunt Sophy concludes to remain in this bright
world a little longer, and the Dr. endorses her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
good intentions, to visit Gettysburg on Memorial
Day (Decoration old style). The President will
deliver a memorial oration. Come with us and
see the great battlefield, which is a wonderful monument
to the nation’s dead, a beautiful picture itself,
and probably you will see and hear things worth
remembering besides. Write to the house, and I
will get your letter when I return in two weeks. But
do come.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l6">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
Edward T. Garrett.
</p>

<p class="p1">Leacraft put down the letter slowly. He was
disappointed. A summons to the west, to the mines
in Arizona, had reached him just the day before,
and he must get out there before a week was over.
He had thought to have finished this affair first,
and to find in the tiresome trip distraction, if Sally
was unfavorable to his appeal, or unexpected interest
if he succeeded in winning her assent. Still
he could readily accept the invitation. He would
be back in May, and, perhaps after all the occasion
might be more favorable. Sally softened into a little
sympathetic humor by her visit to her sick aunt,
and he strengthened by the encouraging reflexion
of having successfully dissipated the little cloud of
misunderstanding, or worse, at the mines, might
produce conditions psychologically adequate to
bring about his victory.</p>

<p>He stepped to the window. The view from it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
was always pleasing, at this moment in the descending
shades of the closing day and with the
vanishing lights hurrying westward beyond the
Potomac, it possessed an ineffable loveliness. The
great white spectre of the Washington monument,
immaterialized and faintly roseate against the
softly flaming skies, and brooding genius-like above
the trees of the Reservation was always there, and
that night it assumed the strangely deceptive but
fascinating vagary of an exhalation, as if built up
from the emanations of the earth, and the vapors
of the air, remaining immobile in the still ether as
a portent or a promise. The man’s face grew
clouded as the fairy obelisk faded, and with the
enveloping darkness became again discernible as a
dull and stony pile.</p>

<p>That evening Leacraft felt particularly restless
and detached. He felt the need of entertainment,
and of entertainment of a sort that would fix his
faculty of thought, awaken speculation, and immerse
him in reasonings and the intricacies of argument.
The few theatrical bills presented no attractions
more weighty than a clever comedian
in a musical farce, a sensational melodrama
(“much better,” said Leacraft), and vaudeville.
Music was shunned; there was nothing quite serious
offered, and then music has so many painful
influences on the apprehensive mind, and is turned
to such cruel uses in the economy of nature, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
making uneasy lovers more agitated. No! he didn’t
wish music. Baffled for an instant, he concluded to
walk. Muscular exercise, mere translation on one’s
legs, is a marvellous remedy for the diabolical
blues, and then it can never be told what the Unseen
holds for you, if you only go out to meet It in the
streets, and amongst other people, hunting, perhaps,
like yourself, diversion from their own inscrutable
megrims. It—the Unseen—may quite
divertingly mix you up in a comedy or a tragedy,
or consolingly give you a glimpse of other human
miseries immeasurably greater than your own.</p>

<p>So walk it was. He had hardly covered two
blocks towards the White House, when he met Dr.
M—, the most amiable and accomplished editor
of the National Museum, and one of those multi-facetted
gentlemen who respond to every scientific
thrill around them, and hold in the myriad piled
up cells of their cerebral cortex the knowledge, selected,
labelled and accessible, of the world. Leacraft
knew the Doctor; had indeed consulted him
upon a chemical reaction, in the elimination of cadmium
from zinc. The Doctor, with genial fervor,
grasped his hand, persuasively put his own disengaged
hand on Leacraft’s back, and dexterously
turned him around with the observation: “You
are going the wrong way. Binn reads a paper to-night
before the Geographical Society, over at the
Museum, on a live subject. It’s about earthquakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
and the Panama Canal. The matter has a good
deal of present interest. The President may be
there. It’s worth your while. Come along.”</p>

<p>Leacraft jumped with pleasure, if an Englishman
may be said ever to respond so animatedly
to a welcome alternative. This met his requirements
exactly. He would, in these surroundings
and under the stimulation of an intellectual effort,
in listening to a lecture which he hoped might possess
literary merit as well, quite forget his immediate
solicitudes.</p>

<p>“It is curious,” resumed Dr. M—, as they directed
their steps towards the umbrageous solitudes
of the Reservation, “how inevitably many
practical questions demand an answer at the hand
of geology or physiography, which are however
never consulted, and disaster follows. In the
spring of 1906 a destructive outbreak of Vesuvius
occurred, and much of the ensuing loss of
life might have been prevented by reliance upon
scientific warnings. Indeed, the loss of life on this
last occasion of the volcano’s activity was greatly
reduced through the premonitions of its approach
by delicate instruments. For that matter, from the
beginning, the vulcanologist, at least as soon as such
a being was a more or less completed phenomenon
in our scientific life, would have pointed out the considerable
risk of living on the flanks of that querulous
protuberance. But it can hardly be expected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
I suppose, that large populations can effect
a change in habitation as long as the dangers that
threaten them occur at long intervals, and the human
fatality of unreasoning trust in luck remains
unchanged. Take for instance the case of the village
of Torre del Greco, four and a half miles
from the foot of Vesuvius. It has been overwhelmed
seventeen times, but the inhabitants, the
survivors, return after each extinction to renew
their futile invocations for another chance.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” queried Leacraft, “that we are to
be informed to-night whether the Canal from the
scientific point of view is a safe investment?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” doubtfully returned the doctor.
“You see, it’s this way. In the spring of the year
that saw the outpouring of lava that invaded the
villages of southern Italy, San Francisco suffered
from a serious earthquake that ruptured the public
structures of the city, dislocated miles of railroad
tracks, ruined the beautiful Stanford University,
shook out the fronts of buildings, and precipitated
a fire that all but wiped out the Queen City of the
Pacific coast. It has been feared that some such
seismic terror might demolish the superb structures
of the canal, and we are to learn to-night
whether these earth movements threaten the new
waterway at the isthmus.”</p>

<p>“I have reason to believe,” rejoined Leacraft,
“that this canal has been itself a source of political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
disturbance, and that it is likely to effect convulsions
in your body politic as dangerous in a social
way as those which brought about the financial
and physical upset at San Francisco.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry on that score,” replied his companion.
“I can tell you that the political texture
of this country is not to be worn to a frazzle by
any collision of interests. Such things adjust
themselves, and the way out only means a new entrance
to brighter prospects and bigger undertakings.
Yes, I guess someone will be hurt, but individuals
don’t count if the whole people are benefited.”</p>

<p>“Still,” remonstrated Leacraft, “the people is
made up of individuals, and it’s simply a fact that
you can’t disturb the equilibrium of one part of
society without jostling the rest.”</p>

<p>“In a way, yes,” slowly answered the doctor.
“But it is quite clear to my mind that the enormous
advantages of the canal will hide from sight
the losses that may be inflicted on the railroads, in
the dislocation of rates, and even that will be temporary,
as the new business raises our population,
and their passenger traffic touches higher and higher
averages.”</p>

<p>“The canal has been an expensive enterprise,”
suggested Leacraft. “It would be a great misfortune
if it brought any kind of material reverses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>“Rubbish,” retorted the doctor; “this prating
is the madness or the envy of croakers and cranks.
Do you think that a connexion between the oceans
that will shorten the route from one to the other
by nearly 6,000 miles, and bring our eastern seaboard,
with all its tremendous agencies of production
within reach of a continent that is slowly becoming
itself occidentalized, and demanding every
day the equipment of the west, is a mercantile delusion?
We are all gainers. It is a scheme of
mutualization on a world-wide scale, but America
distributes the profits and holds the surplus.”</p>

<p>The two friends by this time had reached the entrance
of the Museum, and passing through its
symbolic portals, turned to the left, and found
themselves in a dull room, portentously charged
with an exhaustive exhibit of the commerce of all
nations. Here, on tables and shelves, was displayed
a wonderful assortment of primitive and modern
ships, primeval dugouts, Philippine catamarans,
Mediterranean pirogues, sloops, schooners,
brigs, brigantines, barques, barkentines, luggers,
lighters, caravals, Dutch monstrosities, models of
those extraordinary ships which Motley has described
as “built up like a tower, both at stem and
stern, and presenting in their broad, bulbous prows
their width of beam in proportion to their length,
their depression amidships, and in other sins
against symmetry, as much opposition to progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
over the waves as could well be imagined,” the Latin
trireme and the Greek trireme, the ironclads of
France used in 1855, the monitors of the Civil War,
the recent wonders in battleships, torpedo boats,
and destroyers, with naphtha launches, submarine
wonders, the old time American cutters, and models
of the stately packets that once made the trip
from New York to Portsmouth in fourteen days,
with a various and diversified exhibit of yachts
and pleasure boats, all burnished, japanned and
varnished, and now dimly lustrous in the futile
illumination of the room. Above them on the walls
was a prolix illustration of the hydrography of the
world; charts of currents, pelagic streams, areas
of calms, submarine basins, maps of rainfalls,
prevalent winds, storm regions, precipitation,
barometric maxima and minima, and then still
higher up on the walls, that dispensed knowledge
over each square inch of their dusty and dusky
surfaces, Leacraft descried the tabulations of tonnage
of the merchant marine of the nations of the
earth, with fabulous figures of imports and exports,
and the staple products of this prolific and
motherly old earth, caressed into fructification by
the tireless arms of her scrambling broods of children.</p>

<p>Leacraft was soon deserted by the doctor, who
found occasion to wander among the slowly arriving
scientific gentry and politely inquire after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
health of the particular scientific offspring, whose
tottering footsteps each one was engaged in nurturing
into a more reliant attitude before the world.
Leacraft found the dim room, with its preoccupied
occupants vacantly settling into the seats around
him, and its motley array of picturesque models
strangely congenial. It soothed, by the abrupt
strangeness of its contents, the subdued intellectual
placidity of the audience, and by its mere physical
retirement from the outer bustle of the streets, and
the iterative commonplaces of the hotel corridor.
The exact process of subduction would have been
hard keenly to analyze, but Leacraft seemed to forget
his personal disquietude, and develop into a
congenital oneness with these earnest men and women
around him, eager to know, and not too patient
towards sophistry or pretension. He hardly cared to
know who was who. It made no matter. They all
seemed freed from the petty vanities of living,
and now engrossed in the triumphant tasks of
thought; and he felt himself elevated into a kind
of mental abstraction which eagerly carried on its
functions in an atmosphere of ideas.</p>

<p>And yet how was it, that just above the little
desk which was to receive the honorable burden of
the lecturer’s manuscript, he suddenly distinctly
saw the fair face, with its light blue eyes, its delicate
blush of color, and the slightly mocking pout
of the lips of Sally, the beloved. Leacraft almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
rose upright in his astonishment at the impossible
hallucination. He was leaning forward, half incredulous
of the report of his own senses, and half subjected
by a delicious whim that the apparition was
an augury of success, when a commotion spreading
on all sides of him roused his attention, and the
vision fled. He would have willingly had it stay.
People were rising in his vicinity, and soon the assembly
was on its feet. Some one had entered who
was the cause of this unusual excitement. “The
President” came to his ears, murmured by a dozen
persons near him, and he had hardly sprung to his
own feet when, with many salutations, a strongly
formed, rather bulky man, with a manner of almost
nervous scrutiny passed by him moving down
the aisle to the front. It was indeed President
Roosevelt, and Leacraft, now startled into the most
active interest, slipped forward a seat or two, to
gain a position which might afford him a better
view of this remarkable person. The audience remained
standing until the President, escorted by a
tall red-whiskered gentleman, whom Doctor M—,
who had just turned up in search of his friend,
whispered was Dr. George O. Smith, the distinguished
Director of the Survey, had reached a
seat reserved for him at the front of the hall.</p>

<p>Leacraft now observed more closely the character
of the convocation, and realized its composite and
representative elements. Dr. M—, always himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
immersed in the study of the lives, achievements
and distinctions of the prominent men of the country,
was an enthusiastic verbal <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">cicerone</i> through
the maze of faces which seemed suddenly to have
condensed into a really crowded audience. Here
was Dr. D—, the Alaskan explorer in the early
days of the nineteenth century, the world recognized
authority on the tertiary fossils of the east and
west coasts, and a man of erudition and delightful
literary skill. Beyond him sat Dr. M—, a quiet-faced
man, curator of the National Museum, author
of text books, and gifted with a singularly shrewd
thoughtfulness. At his side sat the sphinx-featured
F—, of Chicago, a gentle-minded scholar, to whom
the Heavens had entrusted the secrets of their meteoritic
denizens, and who, by a more fortunate circumstance,
held a pen of consummate grace. Again
at his side was the Jupiter-browed Ward, an
erratic over the face of the globe, possessed with
a transcendant enthusiasm for the same celestial
visitors that F— described, and chasing them with
the zeal of a lynx in their most inaccessible quarries;
a man of immense conviviality, and controlling
the smouldering fires of a temper that defied
reason or resistance. At the front of the rows of
chairs, and not far from the cynosure of all eyes—the
President—were two notable students of the
past life of the globe, Professors O— and S—, men
whose studies in that amazing storehouse of extinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
life which the West held sealed in its clays and
marls, limestones and sandstones, had continued on
higher and more certain levels the work of Marsh
and Leidy and Cope, and who had transcribed before
the whole world, in monuments of scientific
precision, the most startling confessions of the fossil
dead. To one side, on the same row, sat Prof.
B—, known in two continents, for chemical learning,
especially on that side of chemistry which mingles
insensibly with the laws of matter. And whispering
in his ear, with sundry emphatic nods, sat,
next to him, Dr. R—, of Washington, learned in
the ways of men’s digestion, and the enigmas of
food and the arts of food-makers. In the row behind,
the expressive head of Young, aureoled with
years and honors, was seen, and at his side the face
of Newcomb, who had set the seal of his genius
and industry across the patterned stars. Here
was A— H—, the geologist, reticent and receptive,
there C—, weighted with new responsibilities in
furnishing time to the rapacious biologist, and in
discovering new ways of making this old world.
Behind them sat M—, wise beyond belief in bric-a-brac
and brachiopods, vindictively assertive, and
self-sacrificingly tender and kind. There was
McG— and I—, W—, A—, V—, and B— W—,
bringing to the speaker the homage of archæology,
of petrology, of zoology, and morphology. In a
group of motionless and eager attention were A—,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the sage metereologist, beloved in two continents;
B—, abstruse and difficult, meditative, as a man
might be who kept his hand on the pulses of matter,
and B—, skillful in weighing the atoms of the air,
or probing the volcanoes of the moon. In one line,
mingling in conversation that reached Leacraft’s
ears as a strange jargon of conflicting sciences,
were G—, H— and H—k. And beyond them, mute,
as if by mutual repulsion, sat F—, the agile scrutinizer
of Nature’s crystals; P—, holding in his labyrinthine
memory the names of half a universe of
shells, and B—n, to whom each plant of the wayside
bowed in recognition of a master’s knowledge
of itself. Against the wall, in a triad of sympathy,
was A—, the surgeon; S—, the neurologist, and
R—. And alone, in an isolation that belied his intense
geniality, was K—.</p>

<p>And through all the scientific congeries, which
were far more extended than Leacraft could recognize,
or even Dr. M— recall, was a more garrulous
grouping of politicians, statesmen, diplomats,
ministers, the well dressed circles of the rich,
and the dillettantes, drawn to this unusual assemblage
by the presence of the President.</p>

<p>The quiet and dull room, faded, and with contents
tiresomely drilled into the exact alignments
of a museum hall, took on an almost brilliant appearance.
The fancy amused itself with the
thought that it too felt, in its stagnated life, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
unique occasion, and shook itself into a momentary
wakefulness, to note and record its distinguished
guests, that its streaked walls tried to hide
their unseemly rents, and the multiplied models
and charts struggled to look recent and familiar
and appreciative, amid such intellectual tumult.</p>

<p>But now the audience was forgotten at that theatrical
moment when the chairman and the lecturer
advanced over the platform to assume the
directive guidance of the evening. They did advance
with that curious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gaucherie</i> which somehow
always disables the scientific man in his official
and public utterances, and seems, by some trick of
compensation, the more unredeemable as the unfortunate
victim of its cynical attachment is the more
distinguished and renowned.</p>

<p>Dr. S— stepped gingerly forward, a tall, effective
man with hair hardly sanguine in color, and
quite conventional in arrangement, with a cerebral
development, that somehow disappointingly dwarfed
the lower contours of his face, domed and broad
as it was, with much scholarly promise. He was
followed by the speaker of the evening, Mr. Binn,
who seemed half inclined to screen himself from
observation behind the utterly inadequate profile
of the famous Director. The two men momentarily
catching the full assault of the numerous eyes, each
pair among them being the visible battery of a
questioning and critical mind behind it, underwent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
an obvious confusion of intention and movement,
and became somewhat mixed up with the table and
chairs, and with each other. The Director extricated
himself, came forward to the edge of the platform,
and in a voice of half propitiatory jocularity,
introduced the subject, and the speaker. He alluded
to the favorable conjunction of the meeting of
the American Association for the Advancement of
Science and that of the National Academy of Science,
which brought so many eminent thinkers and
observers together, and administered an especial
emphasis to the question to be considered this evening.
He mentioned, with a deferential bow in the
direction of the President, that they had all been
deeply honored by the presence of the Chief Executive
of the Nation, to whom perhaps, more than
to anyone else in the brilliant audience, the grave
question of the structural and geological stability
of the Isthmus of Darien, was one of overshadowing
interest, and he congratulated everyone that
the subject was in the hand “of one whose geological
fame was beyond dispute, and his carefulness
of statement unimpeached,” and the Director
sat down, pulling off to one side of the stage, lest
his own refulgence might dim the legitimate monopoly
of that article by Dr. Binn. Leacraft observed
that as the lecturer unrolled his manuscript
on the reading desk, the President leaned outward,
adjusted his eyeglasses, and scrutinized the geologist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
who, from a rather embarrassed fumbling
with his sheets, seemed conscious of the inquisition.
A moment later, as if satisfied with his inspection,
the President leaned back, bulky and immobile, and
became an absorbed listener.</p>

<p>Mr. Binn, well known for his lithological studies,
and the possession of a good style, in the scientific
sense, was a short man, evincing, under control,
however, the peptic influences of years, with a face
of decided legibility, in which sense and penetration
seemed equally indicated.</p>

<p>He had provided himself with charts, which had
been distended in an irregular line above his head,
and to these he occasionally referred. His reading
of the important pages before him was clear
and audible, but totally neglectful, of the informing
appliances in elocution, of melody of voice,
accent and deliberation. The lecture was brilliant
and distinguished, and quite comparable in its
qualities to the serious people who had gathered in
great intellectual force to receive its instructions.</p>

<p>Note.—If the reader is too much interested in getting to
the upshot of this tale, let him skip the Lecture. But it is a
mistake. This Lecture was delivered by Mr. Binn on the
Ninth of April, 1909, and is well worth while.</p>
</div>

<p>“Mr. President, Dr. Smith and Ladies and
Gentlemen,” began the speaker; “The area of the
Panama Isthmus and the West Indies has been an
area of successional changes very considerable in
their amount, very persistent in their frequency.
It embraces a tropical area contiguous on its Pacific
side to a meridional section of the earth which
is very unstable, and which almost monopolizes the
contemporaneous volcanic energy of the earth. It
adjoins, or is limited itself on the east, in the Atlantic,
by the Antillean islets, the emergent crests
of submerged volcanic vents. It could be presumptively
held, on these grounds, that the Isthmus
itself partook of these characters of inequilibrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
crustal motions. It might be affirmed, with
a fair amount of precision, that its future history
would continue this impression.</p>

<p>“The West Indies, as defined by Hill, embracing
the islands that with Cuba form a long convexity
terminating in Trinidad, on the coast of S. America,
represent to-day a disintegrated continent.
They are supposed to have embodied a former geographical
unity. It had terrestrial magnitude, and
lay Atlantis-like between South America and North
America, at a time when the present narrow neck
of land upon which our eyes are now, as a nation,
fixed with anxious preoccupation, was itself swept
over by the confluent waters of the two oceans, and
when at that point which now forms an attenuated
avenue of intercourse between North and South
America, the tides of a broad water way alternated
in their allegiance to the East or West coasts of the
separated continents; and possibly a precarious
and fluctuating contribution from the warm Gulf
Stream found its way into the Pacific.</p>

<p>“The discussion of this question opens up for our
consideration the examination of the geological
structure of these oscillating terranes, as to what
these are made up of, and it is evident that we must
reach some general conclusion as to the succession
of the strata composing them, and their relative positions
to each other, as whether they are, in the
language of stratigraphy, conformable or unconformable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
The inference and argument are simple.
If we find that the rocks composing these sections
are crystalline, ancient, and deeply bedded formations,
presumably coexistent, so to speak, with the
original or very early formative beds of the world,
and referable to its beginnings, we are permitted,
by all the analogies of induction and deduction, to
assume that these rocks have at least a relative stability.
On the other hand if our examination reveals
the fact that they are recent deposits, more
or less unconsolidated, easily disturbed in their positions,
easily readjusted in their molecular or physical
structure, then by the most unexceptional and
matter-of-fact observation, we shall regard them as
questionably permanent, indeed as unmistakably
non-resistant to the subterranean forces of terrestrial
mutation.</p>

<p>“Again it is clear that a pile of bricks, or of any
other superimposed building blocks is the more secure,
in its equilibrium, if the component parts
overlie each other, along the broadest surfaces, and
come in contact, or <em>fit</em>, as we say, in parallel position.
If these bricks succeed each other in lines
of brick that are flat, and then in lines that are vertical,
or placed on their thinnest and narrowest
edges, and these two contrasted positions alternate,
or are irregularly disposed with reference to each
other in the same wall, such a construction implies,
involves, elements of weakness, and under the shock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
of any incident force would succumb in ruin more
quickly, and more irretrievably than the former.
If further, the latter building style had suffered
ruptures and dislocations and the gaps or openings
and broken surfaces of contact between its
parts had been invaded or replaced by an irregular
or incongruous assortment of ‘filling,’ differing
from the original bricks in substance, texture
and hardness, then we have a third pattern of
composition that again is weaker than either of its
predecessors. But further. If this least massive
and most vulnerable type of structure has been
subjected to repeated and considerable strains of
elevation and depression, and strains recurrent at
short intervals, then, without inspection, we know
that its interior coherence has been much shattered,
and that it has undergone a progressive dilapidation.</p>

<p>“But I am constrained to go one step farther
in this hypothetical picture of structural defectiveness.
To return to our wall of brick. It can be
made up of bricks laid upon each other in consecutive
tiers; it can be made up of tilted tiers of
bricks, bricks laid on each other, but inclined to a
horizontal plane, and finally it is conceivable that
the bricks may be so arranged as to be inverted in
their relations to the horizontal plane. The diagrams
make clear these contrasted positions.</p>

<p>“Now of all these types of structures the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
obviously best meets the requirements of a type
which will prove the least susceptible to dislocation.
I think that can be apprehended almost without
explanation. A moment’s reflexion will make it
conspicuous.</p>

<p>“The bricks tilted up in inclined tiers or beds,
upon disturbance, if the cohesion between them is
seriously impaired, tend to fall away from each
other, and gravity increases the effects of the initial
displacement. If the bricks lie flat they do not fall
apart, upon the cessation of any push or upheaval,
but remain disordered, falling back into some
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quasi</i>-position of rest. If the bricks are inverted
and form in section a series of lines converging to
the base of the wall, their disarrangement is largely
rectified by their own gravity, bringing them
back into their first positions.</p>

<p>“In Geology strata overlying each other, in succession,
as the bricks do when on their flat faces
are called <em>conformable</em>, if they succeed, one over
the other, with the edges or summits of the lower,
abutting against the horizontal surfaces of the next,
as do the bricks when they are placed in flat and
vertical positions, in alternating strips, that is
<em>unconformability</em>.</p>

<p>“If the strata are usually horizontal like the
evenly piled series of bricks, they are called <em>undisturbed</em>;
if inclined against each other, they are
<em>inclined</em>, and they may make <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">monoclinals</i>, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
one slope, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">anti-clinals</i> when they lean up against
each other like the opposite sides of a peaked roof;
<em>or synclinal</em> when inclined towards each other in
an inverted position like the same roof overturned,
with its ridge pole on the ground, and its inclined
sides lifted into the air, or like the bricks in the
last pattern of structure described.</p>

<p>“When we carry these similes into nature, we
have all kinds of rocks, and we have them in mountains,
in planes, and all the familiar configuration
of the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>“Now we find that those portions of the earth
immediately beneath our feet, extending for a mile
or so into the surface of the earth, are variously
made up of layers, strata, beds, formations, lying
on one another, and <em>conformable</em> or <em>unconformable</em>,
<em>undisturbed</em> or thrown into anticlinal or synclinal
folds; that the material in its general mineral character,
is limestone, marls, or sands and sandstone,
slates, clays, metamorphic rocks like gneiss and
quartzite, etc., and associated with them are granites
which may have been melted lava-like rock before
it cooled and crystallized, while there is plentiful
evidence of abundant outflows of igneous, melted or
viscid rocks; evidences of lines of eruption, of foci,
or craters of eruption. Thus, as in the brick structure,
where unrelated and later material has been
introduced in fissures, gaps, openings, holes, etc.,
of the walls, we have some of the architecture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the earth, an original bedded structure invaded by
very contrasted substances, and which give to that
architecture, as in the brick wall of our homely
illustration, lack of homogeneity, and lack of
strength.</p>

<p>“In the West Indies and on the Isthmus of Panama
we have the states of instability which we have
signalized, viz., secondary deposits of a somewhat
loose and unconsolidated material, and wanting
in the deeply bedded crystalline rocks which in New
England, in the Adirondacks, and the Piedmont
or higher regions abutting on the coastal plain in
the northern United States, furnish a solid, and
probably fundamentally deep seated pediment of
resistance to shock. Again in the West Indies and
in the Isthmus, we have the beds <em>unconformable</em>
over each other, which you will recall in our symbol
of the brick wall, was a feature of weakness;
also these unconformable beds are inclined in <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">anti-clinals</i>,
a further aspect of structural insolvency;
and further these beds have been widely, pervasively,
in places, infiltrated and ruptured by subsequent
introductions of volcanic substance, ashes,
lavas and intrusive magmas. Thus the geological
aggregates present the previously illustrated condition
of fragility, and the absence of the so-called
tectonic elements of rigidity. But still one step
more in our disheartening study of this equatorial
problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>“I, a few moments past, called your attention
to the fact that ‘if this least massive and most vulnerable
type of structure has been subjected to repeated
and considerable strains of elevation and
depression, and strains recurrent at short intervals,
then, without inspection, we know that its
interior has been much shattered, and that it has
undergone a progressive dilapidation.’</p>

<p>“Precisely such catastrophes are discovered in
the history of the geological region now before us.
The islands of the West Indies have been subjected
to great changes of elevation. They have risen and
fallen during the last geological age—the Tertiary—perhaps
four times. In their rise they have gathered
to themselves marginal extensions of land, now
hidden beneath the ocean at comparatively slight
depths, while they have at the same time doubtless
become blended and unified into a great Antillean
continent. This continent was dominated by volcanic
protuberances whose growth upward, over
accumulations of ashes, has been again symptomatic
of undermining operations threatening later
subsidence and submergence.</p>

<p>“In our day we have been called on to deplore
the ravages caused by the eruptions of Mt. Pelee
and La Soufriere, on the Islands of Martinique
and St. Vincent, and it is natural to insist that regions
which have a precarious autonomy, in which
such volcanoes can exist, must be regarded with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
diffidence, as permanent geographical areas.</p>

<p>“It was pointed out by Prof. Robert T. Hill that
the current, and formerly undisputed, conception
that the Rocky Mountains of North America and
the Andes of South America were not only analogous
physiographically, but univalent in fact; that
the continuous elevation of Central America
brought them into an oblique alignment; and that
their mutual prolongations met in the Isthmus of
Panama, was erroneous. It involved a complete
misconception. It was a geographical fallacy, and
leads to misleading conclusions as to the permanency
of this intermedian region, itself pre-eminently
individualized and liberated from the circumstances
and implications of either the Rocky
Mountain Continent or the Andean Continent.
This area has a different geological ancestry. To-day
it invokes an especial treatment, and possibly
expects a future, contrasted with that of the two
great Continents whose longitudinal extension it
contravenes by its east and west lines, by the prerogatives
of a separate origin.</p>

<p>“The Rocky Mountains terminate in the plateau
of Mexico, ‘a little south,’ says Hill, ‘of the
capital of that republic; and that the mountains
have no orographic continuity, or other features in
common with those of the Central American region.’</p>

<p>“And the same authority, describing the terminus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of the Andes, says, ‘The northern end of the
Andean System lies entirely east of the Central
American region, and is separated from it by the
Rio Atrato—the most western of the great Rivers
of Columbia. In fact, the deeply eroded drainage
valley of this stream nearly severs the Pacific
coast from the republic of Columbia, and the isthmian
region, from the South American continent.’</p>

<p>“The Central American volcanoes belong to the
type that is repeated along the Caribbean shores of
Colombia and Venezuela, and those in the Isthmus
of Panama, and those of the great Antilles. The
genesis of this American Mediterranean land-aggregate
was in an independent geological impulse,
and the land aggregate itself impinged by
intersection upon the dominant land surfaces of
North and South America. To bring together
North and South America as a simultaneous geological
phenomena is wrong, to make them other
than an accidental geographical continuity questionable.
It is this intermediate zone—the Antillean
continent with lateral elongations, grasping
within its continental solidarity the parallel zones
of Central America and the Isthmus, that gives
them terrestrial unity. Extend the axis of the
Rocky Mountains, and it passes almost two thousand
miles west of the coast of South America;
extend the axis of the Andes and it bisects the
western extremity of Cuba, and passes along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
seaboard of the United States.</p>

<p>“There is no exact geological identity here, although
there is the strictest geographical homology.
Each is the backbone of a continent, each upheaved
and variously modified, igneously invaded sediments,
derived from some pre-existent continent.
They may be brought into a just comparison, but
they are not strictly parts of one phenomenon.
They are, however, more closely related to each
other, than the Antillean areas are to either. This
Antillean area, I shall here call the Columbian
Continent, as the great discoverer landed at its
two east and west extremities—the land-fall on San
Salvador in the Bermudas, and on the coast of Honduras
in Central America, as well as at Cuba, and
at the mouths of the Orinoco—and his bones rested
for a long time in the soil of San Domingo. It—this
Columbean Continent—is a significant intercalation.
It unites North and South America, but
it unites them subject to the phases of its own generation.</p>

<p>“Let us understand this. There is a system of
growth, a law, if I may so term it, of geomorphic
sameness in the development of large, or for that
matter, small geological territories. The familiar
story of the growth of our North American continent
has been often told. It is a commonplace of
text books. The wide, triangular Archæan nucleus
to the north, the oldest rocks—outlines and outliers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
down the east, and the same in the west—drew the
framing limits of the continent at the first, to be
filled in, up and out, by the momentous additions
through the ages of advancing time. In Europe
less well or simply defined boundaries, the growth
together rather of divided islands, prevailed, and
the picture of development was quite varied, from
the picture in this western world. Again in Africa,
with edges of uplift and centres of depression another
geological tale with its incidents and accessories
infinitely modified, comes into view. And in
this prevalence of structural style, we, geologically
speaking, find a prevalence of certain geological
phases or conditions.</p>

<p>“What were these in the growth and disappearance
of this Columbian continent? What they have
been, we can, with rational probability, assume
they will be.</p>

<p>“The Columbian continent, I have called a dismembered,
a fractionized continent. If from Cuba
through Haiti, Porto Rico, and the lesser Antilles
one land surface obtained, and the now submerged
and radiating gorges, found only as submarine
canyons, were above the ocean, becoming, as Prof.
Spencer has laboriously proven, sub-aerial river
valleys, we should have one presumable phase of
this continent, the phase of its maximum cohesion
and extension. And such a phase is measurably
or, for purposes of argumentative inference, sensibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
established. It is said with careful premeditation
by Hill that ‘the numerous islets of its eastern
border, the Bahamas and Windward chain,
which extend from Florida to the mouth of the
Orinoco, are merely the summits of steep submarine
ridges, which divide the depths of the Atlantic
from those of the Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean
sea; were their waters a few feet lower, these
ridges would completely landlock the seas from the
ocean.’</p>

<p>“When thus constituted, it afforded a display of
physical features of astonishing contrasts, and its
mere scenic resources were doubtless of unparalleled
splendor, and, as to-day, it was involved in the
luxuriant productivity of the tropics. Its mountains
measuring now as high as eleven thousand
feet above the sea level, were then thrust upward
into stupendous peaks, by the addition of the sloping
miles which are now below the ocean. We can
imagine the extreme wonderfulness of this continent,
uniting in an unbroken but marvellously varied
expression of physical and vegetable contrast,
the plains, valleys, and mountains of Cuba, the
towering and draped peaks of Jamaica, the confusion
of the gloomy vales and ranges of Hayti and
San Domingo, the levels and coastal ranges of
Porto Rico, and the manifold picturesque charms
of the Lesser Antilles, lifting high into the ceaseless
currents of the trade winds the smoking summits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of a chain of disturbed volcanoes. All, in the
boundless abundance of its natural endowment of
loveliness, and productivity, formed an unique and
extravagantly ornamented landscape, an area
whose highest elevations contemplated the remote
waters of the shrunk Atlantic, from pinnacles
raised ten to twenty thousand feet above its azure
waves. Nor is this all. This hypothetical—the
Columbian—continent, may have had connexions
with Central America through projecting and peninsulated
capes, reaching through Jamaica to Yucatan
or Honduras, and wide intervals of dividing
gulfs of water, in all probability sundered it from
North or South America, and it remained, as I
here emphatically insist, it remains to-day, a geographical
and geological phenomenon, unrelated to
the great continents, to which through their preponderating
value, the mind almost unpremeditatingly
assigns it.</p>

<p>“But at the period of this greatest elevation,
when this tropical region assumed individual independence,
and embodied a geognostic importance
comparable to the vast continents it lay between—at
this time—the Isthmus of Panama did not exist,
and through a wide water-way the Atlantic mingled
its tides with those of the Pacific.</p>

<p>“We are thus led to believe that as between the
West Indian terranes and the neck of land now embraced
in the Isthmus of Panama, we have a relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
of <em>Isostacy</em>.’”</p>

<p>The speaker, armed with this formidable verbal
equipment of attack upon his audience, had walked
to the front of the platform, and, harboring some
unusual confidence in his powers, had deserted his
manuscript. <em>Isostacy</em>, he had realized, possessed
probably unqualified novelty, and by way of assurance,
lest its terrors might empty the hall, he assumed
a colloquial relation to his dazed hearers,
and offered an explanation of this unexpected
mystery. “Isostacy,” he resumed, “is simply
this: Equilibrium. It is the maintenance of average
level—as if one part of the earth’s surface was
pushed up, above a mean level, then the requirements
of Isostacy would depress another part, below
it. We can also call it the adjustment of a
changing load, as if through depression, from the
dumping upon the floor of the ocean of a great
amount of sediment, derived from the land surface
of the earth, neighboring areas of the land of the
oceanic floors were raised. Two contiguous regions
<em>might</em>—and,” the lecturer turned directly toward
the President, who in his own earnestness of
attention had elbowed himself round into a direct
line with Mr. Binn, “in the case of the West Indian
continent and the Isthmus of Panama, <em>have</em>
maintained between them, an up and down reciprocity
of movement, as, when one was up, the other
was down, and vice versa.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>Mr. Binn looked introspectively at the walls and
ceilings of the room, as if engaged in a mental rehearsal
and review of his staggering statement, and
returned to his desk and manuscript, satisfied that
he had thrown the assembly into an uneasy apprehension
of danger. He again began his reading:
“It is true, if I understand Mr. Spencer correctly,
that the Atlantic ocean was cut off by the elevation
of the Columbian Continent from even the interior
basins of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of
Mexico, at least in early pliocene times; that these
depressions were then broad plains receiving in
part the drainage of the Antillean highlands; this
again emptying into the Pacific ocean. But this is
not a proven theory, and it involves an extravagant
readjustment of the physical features of a region
that to my mind more expressively can be considered
immemorially permanent, in their general aspects,
at least. I reiterate the reciprocity of movement
between the Antillean Continent and the Isthmus
of Panama. The cause I have suggested may
be untenable—but there seems strong geological
proof of some such alternating relation between the
west and east sides of this inter-related region, the
Great Antilles on one side, the Isthmus of Central
America on the other.</p>

<p>“Our survey of the question produces one impression,
and that very forcibly, viz.: that this narrow
ridge of separation is ephemeral, that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
perishable, that under the tests or against the
shocks of earth strains, it will succumb, and”—the
lecturer raised his voice, half turned deferentially
to the chairman, Dr. Smith, who accepted the
attention with an assenting nod—“again the waters
of the two oceans will unite, and the impetuous violence
of the rushing oceanic river, the Gulf Stream,
that now races and boils through the Caribbean Sea,
will fling its torrential waves across this divide into
the Pacific.”</p>

<p>The audience that with manifest absorption had
thus far followed the speaker, was disturbed. A
movement of chairs, a half audible protest of whispered
incredulity, and a sensible emanation around
him, of mental repugnance to such a catastrophe,
made Leacraft momentarily turn his eyes from
Mr. Binn to the frowning countenances at his side.</p>

<p>“But,” the speaker raised his voice with reassuring
quickness, as if to stay the emotional resistance
he had aroused, “we have no reason to believe
that in our lifetime, or the lifetimes of many generations
yet to come, so strange a reversal of present
conditions should occur. And again, that in this
matter, we may be calmly judicial, we have reason
at least for a moderate fear. Whatever state of
unstable equilibrium, of unadjusted balance is implied,
or actually is resident in this section of our
earth, a section that has undergone the extremes of
hypsometrical displacement, we may conceive that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
like the explosive cap, or the compressed spring, or
the bent bow, it will win instant relief upon the impact
of any force, deep-seated enough, and powerful
enough, to liberate its tectonic strain.</p>

<p>“I am thus brought to consider that world-wide
source of terrestrial deformation—earthquakes;
but I should forget the indulgence of your patience
up to this point, if I should now undertake any
partial review of these astonishing and alarming
occurrences. I am deeply impressed, however, with
an aspect of the subject that demands attention, that
throws into sharp relief the prophecies of disaster,
with which, willingly or unwillingly, we have all
become familiar.”</p>

<p>The lecturer here rolled forward to the front of
the platform, a blackboard on which in colored
chalks the earth, looking somewhat like a shortened
egg, with its north and south poles situated on the
long, flattened sides, was depicted; while a black
line or axis drawn through it terminated in the Sahara
Desert on one side, and near the Society Islands
on the other. Two ominous circles in vermillion
were described on it, concentric respectively
with the ends of the black line, one sweeping along
the western coast of North and South America, and
crossing the Isthmus of Panama, the other encircling
the coasts of Africa and gathering in their
fatal course the Azores, Canaries, and the Cape
Verde Islands. And on both these terrifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
curves, in black letters, was printed the hypnotic intimation
“Belt of Weakness or Earthquake Ring.”
The effect on the audience was sufficiently impressive.
The staring rude drawing around which a
cyclone of blue scratches, purporting to be clouds,
was expressively raging, intensely steeped the observers
in a spell of wonder and trepidation. Even
Leacraft, by the contagion of a common obsession,
craned his neck, and fixed his eyes with a stupid
absorption upon the crazy and paradoxical diagram.</p>

<p>The speaker continued, noticing with undisguised
satisfaction the ocular concentration produced by
his obnoxious figure, with its anomalous portents:
“It is well known that we have in the boundaries,
or shore lines of the Pacific, a surprisingly larger
number of earthquakes recorded, than anywhere
else in the world, and this seems in some way coincident
with the prevalence of active volcanoes in
the same region. Prof. Haughton has enumerated
for the world 407 volcanoes, 225 of which are active.
Of these latter, 172 are on the margin of the
Pacific. Prof. Milne, who lived a long time in
Japan, for the express purpose of studying the
earthquake problem of those islands, has observed
the surprising frequency of their earthquakes, and
it is a volcanic zone they occupy. We have in contradistinction
to this area about the Pacific a reversed
circle which envelopes the western coast of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Africa, and by this chart,” here the lecturer pushed
back the blackboard, and, standing alongside of it,
began, with a pointer of elucidation, a direct allocution
to that subject of confusion, “we are made
immediately cognizant of the opposite and yet symmetrical
disposition of these zones. This should
have from its simplicity and a quasi-permanency,
in its phenomena—its earthquake phenomena—a
general explanation. The explanation is not reassuring;
it is not proven, but it is accepted by many,
and has, for me, a very reasonable probability. Let
us at least not recoil from its consideration.”</p>

<p>Under the encouragement of this exhortation, the
audience seemed to slide forward in their seats a
few inches, with the impetus of a renewed hope.</p>

<p>“This chart,” said the speaker, “presents to you
the structural conception of Professors Jeans and
Sollas, of the form of the earth. It is the shape
more or less familiar to you, commonly known as a
pear-shaped earth, the tip carrying the Sahara Desert
on its bulging top, and its broader and inferior
extremity holding the disturbed Pacific basin.</p>

<p>“Now it makes a very practical difference what
the shape of the earth is, because the shape affects
the stability, has an important influence upon the
fluctuating strains under its surface. Observe that
the chart has developed, upon two circles of instability,
these lines of weakness,” and the lecturer
swept his pointer over the contrasted belts, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
around Africa, and the other inflicting the west
coast of North America with its ominous intersection.
The pointer paused on the latter circle, stopping
near the position of San Francisco. “You recall,”
the speaker continued, “the terrifying affliction
of this great city in 1906, and the pall of discouragement
and gloom which it cast over the region
in which the city naturally held the sway of
mercantile supremacy. Now it was shown by Prof.
H. H. Turner, the English astronomer, that San
Francisco lies on one of the two great earthquake
rings, which surround the end of the pear, as in
this chart, like wrinkles produced by the crowding
down of the protuberances under the force of gravitation.
And, according to this view, such rings,
marking lines of weakness and yielding in the rocks
would not exist, if the earth was, in its shape, what
we most usually assume to be its figure, an oblate
spheroid, with the present north and south poles at
the ends of its axis of rotation, to which axis of rotation
the rest of the earth was symmetrically disposed.</p>

<p>“The existence of these earthquake and volcanic
rings was known before the pear theory had been
defined, but then of course their relation with any
peculiar form of the earth was not understood. The
ring surrounding the Pacific, or butt end of the pear
includes a large part of the shores of the Pacific
Ocean, running from Alaska down to the western<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
coast of South America, then across to the East
Indies, and back, around the other side, through
Japan. The other ring is somewhat smaller in diameter,
including the earthquake regions of West
Africa and the Atlantic Islands. Now the point of
interest is this, as Garrett P. Serviss has significantly
said, ‘If the pear hypothesis is accepted, and
the two great earthquake rings are found to be
definitely connected with the strains to which the
planet is subjected in its effort to attain a state of
equilibrium, under the forces of its own gravitation
and rotation, which tend to compel it into spheroidal
shape, then we have a perfectly rational explanation
of the existence of certain places where earthquakes
are sure to occur more or less frequently,
and of other places, like eastern America, where
they are very rare and never of maximum violence.’</p>

<p>“Every one present this evening,” and the lecturer
gave an embracing wave of his hand, “knows
of the singular aberrancy in the rotational motion
of the earth, which has been often geographically
described as the ‘wobbling of the poles.’ Astronomers
have proven a real tipping of the poles alternately
to one side, and then to the other, a swaying
of the poles like the recurrent oscillations of a top
as it ‘goes to sleep.’ But this swaying in the
earth’s case is periodic and unchanging. It is
sometimes rather abrupt, and at other times the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
tipping is regulated and progressive; but it is established,
and has had a generally accepted explanation,
in the attraction of the swelling equatorial
prominence of the earth by the sun and moon, while
suggestions have also been made that it was due to
internal shiftings of mass, or to changes of exterior
weightings, through the alternate and variable formation
and melting of polar snows.</p>

<p>“But it has in the light of the present theory of
the pear-shaped earth a new and rather startling
explanation.</p>

<p>“We are, however, this evening, not so much concerned
with the broader cosmic aspects of this state
of affairs, as with the immediate consequences to
the permanence of our land surfaces.</p>

<p>“The mechanics of this condition and its possible
effectiveness in developing contrary placed
zones of rupture can be easily conceived. This
awkwardly conditioned sphere, revolving upon a
shorter diameter—revolving also with astonishing
velocity—and bearing at either extremity of its
longer axis unequal masses, is obviously in a state
of peripheral strain, that is, it is in strain at such
distances from either of the disproportioned ends,
the one in the south seas, the other in the desert of
Sahara, as would represent the more or less sharply
sloping surface from its average rotundity, towards
these oblique extremities.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” the speaker seemed excitedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
rushing into danger, but with a fixed expression,
aimed somewhere at the blank and uninfluential
physiognomies at the back of the hall; like that of
an engineer who can neither restrain nor reverse
the speed which may either carry him safely over
a tottering support or plunge his train to the bottom
of the gulch; “Gentlemen, the Isthmus of Panama
is in this zone; <em>the Canal is there</em>!” this last
reminder uttered with no very reasonable deliberation,
“and it is to my mind an absolutely established
certainty, that the secular instability of that
region, shown by geological investigation, will
again become apparent; and”—he raised his voice
with a kind of exhalation of defiance, as if he
spurned equivocation and invited denial—“and, it
will become apparent with increased violence.</p>

<p>“This conclusion is unwelcome; it may seem destructive
to those natural hopes which the approaching
completion of this wonderful enterprise—the
Panama Canal—have so freely and inevitably
fostered. Science in the last resource to her councils
must be austerely judicial. She cannot take
cognizance of man’s projects or respect his hopes.
The Panama Canal as part of the Isthmus of Panama
participates in all the vicissitudes of the latter,
and we know that those vicissitudes mean dislocation
and subsidence. When such frightful results
will happen, <em>it is impossible to say</em>; that they must
happen, <em>we can positively assert</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>The lecture was over. The lecturer retreated,
and again repeated his deferential nod to the
chairman, Dr. Smith, as if importuning his assistance
in corroboration of his mournful vaticination.
The audience still remained immobile, coagulated
into a sort of mental prostration by this
dismal prophecy, and yet again as if contemplating,
like a cat’s stagnation, preparatory to its murderous
spring, some outward and physical resentment.
And the spring came.</p>

<p>In the middle of the hall arose a tall and alert figure,
perhaps noticeably bent, as if from the effort
of attention, or perchance from forensic habits;
for the man, as Dr. M— quickly informed Leacraft,
was Senator Tillman, of South Carolina.
The face of this sudden expostulant was handsome
in the extreme, and the features, strongly marked,
were blended together in an expression of youthfulness
that seemed to win a strange charm from their
association with the white hair, and the just beginning
wrinkles of advancing years.</p>

<p>Senator Tillman lost no time. His interruption
was decisively intentional. It was part of an impulsive
impassioned nature. Shaking his index
finger, which, from long practice, pointed undeviatingly
at the object of his remarks, the Senator,
in a voice harsh and penetrating, began: “My
dear sir, we are indebted to you for information.
But we stop there. We are not required to credit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
you with prediction. This scientific discussion will
not alter our confidence nor stop the work on the
Canal. It can’t. I’m not inclined to think that this
nation will be stultified by the oracles of geology;
it is a matter of simple determination that science
makes mistakes—and I would advise no one in this
room within the hearing of your voice, and no one
outside of it, to whose eyes your reported views
will appear, to allow them a scintilla of serious import.</p>

<p>“In 1906, Mark Smith, a voteless delegate to
Congress from Arizona, told this story: ‘Once,’
commented Smith, ‘a couple of my friends were riding
through a desolate bit of country in Arizona
near the Mexican border. Presently they came
upon a man who was hanging by the neck from
the limb of a tree. A couple of buzzards were
roosting above him, but they made no attack upon
him. My friends drove away the buzzards and
discovered on the breast of the dead man a placard
bearing these words: “<em>This was a very bad man
in some respects and a damn sight worse in
others.</em>“</p>

<p>“‘My friends accounted for the moderation of
the buzzards on the theory that they had read the
placard.’</p>

<p>“That was all Smith had to say, but it was assumed
that he agreed with the opinion of the other
men about the subject of their discussion. Well, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
beg to say of science that it is very bad in some respects,
and a damn sight worse in others, and its
present conclusion in regard to the Isthmus of
Panama is one of the latter.”</p>

<p>The audience, long before this denoument to the
Senator’s retort was reached, had arisen; the President
had arisen also, and stood with his back to the
stage, facing the Senator, steadily growing more
unrestrained and angry. Leacraft and Dr. M—
were half standing, their hands supporting them
on the backs of the chairs of the men in front of
them. The scene was interesting, and the first
movement toward repression of the Senator succumbed
to curiosity, and in all directions, the intelligent
faces about them were variously disturbed
by symptoms of vexation or amusement. It was uncommonly
entertaining. Mr. Binn and Dr. Smith,
with becoming smiles of moderation, were
drawn to the front of the platform, and no one,
after the Senator had swung into the torrential
flow of his remonstrance, thought of anything else
but to catch, almost breathlessly, his words. When
he concluded, a wave of laughter, genuine, but a
little nervous, went through the assembly. Then
the President stepped to the aisle, turned a moment
to shake the hand of the lecturer, and offer him his
congratulations, and bowed to Dr. Smith. In an
instant the aisle way was clear. The President
moved on between the applauding people, and as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
came opposite Senator Tillman, who had himself
pressed toward the egress, as if to intercept him
he stopped. There was a quick, instinctive restraint.
Everyone waited for his word. “Senator
Tillman,” the President spoke with sharp emphasis,
“I thank you for restoring our spirits. I
remember Mark Smith. I remember he took my
advice in accepting the Statehood Bill. You may
have misapplied his story, but you have at least
furnished us with a novel reason for encouragement.”</p>

<p>Again the applause broke out, and the President
disappeared, the audience decorously dispersed
and followed him, and Leacraft and Dr. M— soon
found themselves on Pennsylvania avenue, walking
rapidly and silently.</p>

<span class="subhead">BALTIMORE, MAY 29, 1909.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Leacraft finished his task in the west. The disputes
were smoothed out, the differences adjudicated,
and a problem or so which had mixed up the
overseer and the Mining Superintendent at the
mines in an acute wrangle, disposed of. He was
back to Washington on his way to Baltimore and
Sally Garrett. The invitation from Ned Garrett
to visit Baltimore and go with Sally and himself
to Gettysburg on the twentieth of May, had been
accepted, and every movement he had made, each
step he had taken, since that memorable ninth of
April when he first learned of the complexion of
political affairs in the United States, and had
heard Mr. Binn’s remarkable lecture, had been
thoughtfully adjusted to getting back in time for
the pleasure and the opportunity of seeing Sally.</p>

<p>His own earnest desire to possess her for himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
to compel her wayward and tantalizing spirit
to acknowledge his mastery had increased, and like
most young men in similar relations to the unknown
quantity of susceptibility in a popular
young woman’s heart his anxiety grew with every
lessening minute between the present and the moment
of confession. But at any rate Leacraft felt
no indecision. Come what might he had no misgivings
about his own feelings, and lingered, with
no trepidation, over the thought of asking Miss
Garrett to marry him. Defeat was preferable to
the hardship of doubt. He would be less miserable
after rejection, if rejection it was, than he was
now; tormented with an immeasurable uncertainty.
And his English heaviness, that semi-sepulchral
seriousness which by some amusing compensation
in the gifts of Nature is mingled with the
very substantial merits of these people, induced a
rather grim sadness in his mind, and he reached the
door of 72 Monument Square, Baltimore, with no
actual palpitation, but with a strained sense of the
importance of his own fate which made him grave.</p>

<p>Leacraft had many personal merits. He had an
excellent mind, a reasonably fearless heart, a sense
of justice, itself the best gift of God to man, and a
face, which if not distinguished by remarkable
beauty became, under the excitement of feeling,
and in the more propitious circumstances of good
health, attractive, from a manly comeliness, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
handsome perhaps, but certainly not commonplace.
And he had physique. He was tall and strong, and
his strength acknowledged obedience to an intelligence
which made it formidable.</p>

<p>The door of the quiet house before which he
stood, opened and there—Leacraft almost stumbled
into unconsciousness—<em>as if expecting him</em>, as if flying
on the wings of—if not Love, something else
uncommonly pleasant—as if impatient to cross the
laggard moments which separated them—was
Sally Garrett.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to reproduce in words this
difficult and puzzling young lady; difficult to impart
by any means less effective than painting or
have proven ineffective, unless somehow helped
out by personal acquaintanceship—the impression
which gave both to her active admirers, and to
those who, for reasons best known to themselves,
had tried to forget her charms. Sally was decidedly
pretty, she readily, under the phases of excitement
and gayety moved upward into the realms
of beauty. She was fair, not large, delicately modelled,
with perniciously accomplished eyes that
looked out from beneath the pencilled eye-brows,
and under their long lashes, with all kinds of provocative
invitations, that were no sooner accepted
than their desperate little giver revoked them with
derision and anger.</p>

<p>Her lips, of course met the most scrupulous requirements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
of the critic, and her teeth were as fatally
perfect. In coloring she furnished an example
of protean adaptibility. The emblems of fury
were seen in her flushed cheeks, and the tokens of
contrition in the same when they grew pale with
grief. This was the secret of her compelling art.
She bowed to all emotions, and as they controlled
her they set upon her face the evidence of their
presence, refined by the resistance of a nature
which abhorred wrong feelings, improved by the
welcome of a spirit which was magnanimous and
sympathetic. No wonder that Leacraft loved her.
No wonder that a bewildered lot of other young
men were in a similar predicament.</p>

<p>I presume at this point I owe some deference to
feminine importunity. How was Sally dressed?
Well; Sally had good taste, perhaps a trifle insubordinate
by nature, but a rigorous subjection to
good social usage had made it fairly unimpeachable.
At that particular moment in the afternoon
of May 27th, 1909, after his extrication from the
subterranean embraces of the Baltimore and Ohio
tunnel, and an uninspired walk along Charles
street, Sally to Leacraft’s eyes presented the acme
of sartorial perfection. She wore a white lisseree
gown in which were inwoven threads of gray
which gave it “atmosphere,” a kind of filmyness
quite indescribable, but very inviting—above that,
a waist of almost the same color, without the gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
threads, and fitting tightly at the wrists with faintly
voluminous sleeves—a stock of daffodill yellow
encircled by an aqua-marine necklace, and in her
clustering golden brown cascades of hair, rushed
up into a chaste confinement between pearl-starred
combs—she had thrust an amethyst aigrette.
It was a willful thought, a vagary of sheer carelessness.
But it looked well, and—Leacraft might
have danced a jig (if he knew how) of pure ecstacy;
and if his impurturbable nature would have
permitted so gross a jest—it was one Leacraft had
himself given her only last Christmas. You can
see or infer ladies that your attractive sister, given,
as I have tried to do, her natural adaptibility
for embellishment, must have looked more than
pleasing, that to a young man approaching her
with idolatry in his heart and prayers on his lips
she must have looked very nearly like the embodyment
of the feminine ideal, like that inscrutable
loveliness which first wins from a man his careless
notice, and the next moment has him chained
to its feet in servitude.</p>

<p>Well; such were the circumstances, and Leacraft
hastily removing his hat looked with all his eyes at
the fair vision, and found himself embarrassed in
speaking his formal salutation:</p>

<p>“How do you do, Miss Garrett?” “Why, Mr.
Leacraft,” replied the arch tormenter; “I thought
it was Ned. He has just gone to get our tickets for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
to-morrow. And you, Mr. Leacraft, go with us?
You will see our great battle field and hear our
President. I’m sure you will find both wonderful.
But come in, Mr. Leacraft.”</p>

<p>The vision with intoxicating grace swung back
the door and preceded the tongue-tied suitor to the
parlor. Mr. Leacraft left his hat and valise in the
hall, and followed. Another instant, they were both
seated in the deep room from whose walls the portraits
of ancient and meagre, or stately and peptic
Garretts, looked down upon them, and in looking
were amused or distressed, according to their nature,
at the display of modern elegance, helped out
by a tasteful condescension to antiquities and heirlooms.</p>

<p>The next moment was successfully engaged in
greeting Mrs. Garrett, the mother of the vision, a
dignified and well preserved lady, who honored
all her children’s friends with motherly hospitality,
but resented mentally all masculine strategy,
whose ulterior aims were the destruction of her
daughter’s peace of mind. Her devotion to her
daughter was itself part of a devotion which made
every thing which bore the Garrett name sacred in
her eyes, and which reflected a family pride, unmitigating
in its self-exaction, unrelenting in its engrossing
enmity to all that offended it.</p>

<p>“Ned will be glad to find you here Mr. Leacraft.
It was only last night that Ned said he wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
if you had got rid of the business engagements that
took you out west, and expressed himself willing
to believe that if you had, you would not forget his
invitation for Decoration Day at Gettysburg.” It
was the voice of Mrs. Garrett, a little somnolent in
quality, with a subdued melodiousness, and monotonously
even in tone.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mrs. Garrett, few things could have
less readily escaped my mind. It has been an alleviation
to think of it when I got bored with quarrelsome
miners. Whatever good luck I have had
in settling the mine troubles came from my own
eagerness to get back to Baltimore,” and Leacraft
turned with, actually, a very grave face towards
the meditative Sally.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Leacraft,” said that unconscionable
woman, “we have Ned’s old classmate, Brig Barry,
to go with us to Gettysburg. He is in the army,
a lieutenant, who has fought Indians on the reservations,
has lots of medals for bravery and is just the
best thing in the way of a man you ever saw. I
half think your English prejudices will be a little
discouraged when you see him, or else you will love
him as well as we do,” and this merciless compound
of mischief and bewitching beauty looked
out of her blue gray eyes with an absurd intimation
of solitude which half made Leacraft forget
manners.</p>

<p>“Yes,” acquiesced Mrs. Garrett, “Mr. Barry is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
great favorite. I almost fear that Mr. Leacraft
will find him unreasonably popular.”</p>

<p>“I am sure,” replied that rapidly aspiring sycophant,
“that I ought to feel no inclination to impugn
Miss Garrett’s good taste.”</p>

<p>This was so evident an affectation to shield a too
obvious chagrin that the wicked object of the inuendo
simply laughed outright and was vicious
enough to reply that “she had never felt it necessary
for her own comfort to have her own personal
opinions endorsed by any one,” a cruel barb
that lacerated the tender Englishman feelings immensely.</p>

<p>The next instant the front door opened with a
rough shake, and a commotion of hurrying feet announced
the arrival of Ned Garrett. Ned Garrett
was a typical American of the best breed, and with
the most unmistakable marks of that American
suavity, sweetness and splendid confidence, not a
whit tainted with assumption or vanity, which
makes the American man the best type of man the
world over. He, too, was tall and fair, with fascinating
aplomb, and a frank surrender to the claim of
friendship, without a too credulous endorsement
of all social paper not readily negotiable. As he
saw Leacraft he ran to him with a glad welcome of
surprise and pleasure. “Good, Burney; I am right
glad to see you. I knew you would not forget us,
and you will have great reason to be satisfied with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
yourself for coming. The affair at Gettysburg to-morrow
will be splendid. The President will give
us something characteristic, the day will be the
Nation’s, and the reunion of the veterans of both
sides—you know this country once tried to strangle
itself with its own hands—will be honored by a
tremendous turn-out of people. I know,”—with a
laugh,—“that you Englishmen hate crowds, unless
they are turned to good account in celebrating the
Lord Mayor’s day, or the jubilee of a king, or something
swell and uninteresting, but it won’t hurt you
to see the meaning of a great land’s reverence for
its fallen dead,” and the big fellow full of enthusiasm,
his handsome countenance dilated with pride,
shook Leacraft’s hand, who was quite as delighted
to greet his friend, whom he appreciated on his own
account, without considering his influential relations
to the desirable Sally.</p>

<p>Sally and her mother were now standing and,
with, from the former a smile of approval and
from the latter a gesture of satisfaction the two
ladies departed, a servant appeared, and the young
men ascended the stairs to prepare for dinner.</p>

<p>A variety of intentions had been coursing
through Leacraft’s mind, and while ostensibly he
was engaged in the commonplaces of address an
interior agitation of plans and designs, all indubitably
pointed towards the denouement of his visit,
were tingling through his cerebral cortex with various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
success. He felt a sudden pressure of prudence
assert itself, as if by some sort of psychological
premonition he was made aware of the danger
of temerity.</p>

<p>Left by Ned Garrett to assume the conventional
apparel for dinner, and lingering with a delighted
inspection of the details of his bedroom which he
thought just reflected, to the nice point of a modest
assertion of feminine adroitness, a really exquisite
taste, he ran over the possible and best programme
for the short campaign he felt it necessary to devise
for the capture of the gentle and ethereal enemy.
As he gazed, with increasing uneasiness, and poorly
repressed envy at Henry’s piquant and picturesque
colored sketches of “A Virginia Wedding,” and
“The Departure of the Bride,” which offered
themselves so suggestively between the white curtains
on the saffron tinted paper, he came to this
conclusion. He would that evening, if the occasion
presented itself for a really favorable interview,
let Sally know how much he thought of her, and
how hopelessly unhappy he must become, if she
could furnish him with no encouragement. That
would do just now; but when they got to Gettysburg
he might expect to find a convenient moment
to be more explicit, indeed to urge her to the critical
extremity of telling him what he might hope
for.</p>

<p>This progressive method he fancied promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the best results, and, his thoughts still recalling
with infatuation the uncalled for insertion of his
aigrette in her hair on the very day when he was
expected, he imagined if there was not absolute surrender
on Sally’s part now, there might be compromising
negotiations for surrender later.</p>

<p>With complacency, he looked at himself in the
glass, walked to the hallway and descended. He
had reached the broad stairway which entered the
centre of the first floor of this sumptuous home, descending
on the two sides in a series of separate
steps, and then uniting into a wide terrace of steps,
expanding upon the hall at the bottom, and guarded
by a balustrade, which ended in two newel posts
of surprising proportions, each carrying an enormous
Rokewood vase, from which sprang a mingled
white and red exuberance of sweet alyssum
and geranium. As Leacraft stood at the top of the
terrace of steps, he commanded a full view of the
lower hall. And right beneath him, at the foot of
the terrace, under the Rokewood vases, he saw Sally
Garrett—the girl whom a moment ago he had with
some unction and self-flattery ventured to think
was not averse to his attentions—pinning on the
lapel of the evening suit of a most offensively good
looking young man, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boutonniere</i> of geranium and
alyssum, filched (the theft was evident) from the
great vase above their heads, and to accomplish
which, it seemed to the maddened observation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Leacraft, that the young man must have lifted the
young lady. This was a conjunction of agencies too
terrible to dwell on with equanimity, and in pure
fright Leacraft stopped a moment, and became an
involuntary spy upon proceedings evidently not
intended for an inspection so inimical as his.</p>

<p>It was Sally’s voice: “Well, Brig, I must confess
that as an accomplice in crime you are shockingly
cool. It was quite unnecessary for you to
expect more than the flowers; and yet”—Leacraft
seemed to hit the balustrade with his foot. The
interruption was perhaps involuntary. In Leacraft’s
condition, human nature could not stand a
more excruciating strain. Sally looked up. So
did the young man. “Oh, Mr. Leacraft, this is fortunate.
I want you and Mr. Barry to be excellent
friends. Mr. Barry is wonderfully strong, and you
are so wise. With his agility, and your advice,
I will have two escorts to-morrow that will save
me from any exertion of mind or body. Mr. Barry
will help me over the hard places, and you will explain
things. Pardon,” with a coquettish glance at
her companion and a demure courtesy to Leacraft;
“you must go through the usual introductions. My
cousin, Mr. Barry, Mr. Leacraft. Remember, I
rely upon both of you, and you must be as amicable
as doves,” and with that equivocal enforcement of
neutrality, this impossible beauty vanished.</p>

<p>Ned Garrett appeared, and saved the situation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
or at least diminished an insufferable embarrassment.
The three men were the next instant summoned
to dinner. They were met at the door of
the dining-room by Mr. Garrett, a tall gentleman,
still giving evidence of an athletic youth. Mr. Garrett
was a man somewhat tormented with impatience,
but genial withal, and possessing a singular
power of rapid utterance, conjoined also with the
power of business-like demonstration. He shook
hands with Leacraft cordially, and addressed a
salutation of flattering familiarity to Mr. Barry.</p>

<p>Leacraft had suffered a very staggering blow,
as he recalled the affair of the stairway, and he
fell back, with only a half-satisfied security, upon
Sally’s intimation that this unwelcome intruder—the
Brig Barry of her previous encomiums—was
a cousin. And the plague of it all was that he
(Leacraft) was overpoweringly conscious of this
same Brig Barry’s indisputable charms. Mr. Brig
was a type of physical perfection. He carried on
straight, but not too broad, shoulders, a finely
shaped head, such which, at their best, are only
seen in America; a head which announced to the
world its intelligent emotions through the medium
of an expressive face, wherein brown eyes, dark,
straight eyebrows, a strong, large mouth, an
aquiline nose, and blue veined temples, overhung by
short, curled hair, combining their mutually enhancing
details in making their young owner the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
target of feminine admiration. Cousins are by no
means denied the privileges of marital union, and
as there are all kinds of cousins, and the privilege
is less and less questionable according to the numerical
distance between them, it became a matter
of preliminary importance for Leacraft to find out
what kind of a cousin Brig Barry was to Sally Garrett.</p>

<p>In pondering sadly over this uncertainty his well
formed plans, so agreeably outlined during his toilet,
fell into disorder, and, as it were, evaporated.
His agony of heart was not relieved when he observed
the cruel object of his misgivings. Sally
was placed at his side at the dinner table; opposite
them sat Mr. Barry and Ned Garrett, and the ends
of the table commodiously accommodated Mr. and
Mrs. Garrett. Sally was radiant; she was well
dressed, and—Leacraft’s eyes first sought its place—the
aigrette was gone, and he noticed, acutely conscious
of all telltale signals of interference by
others with his own designs, a solitaire diamond
ring on her right hand. His discomfiture was complete.
It was a sad discovery, and Sally, gleaming
with a light of happiness it was not his good luck
to dispense, relentlessly added to his distress by
showering the loathed Brig Barry with glances of
commendation and approval.</p>

<p>But when could this engagement—he shuddered
at the word—have been made? Leacraft, solicitous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
from the moment he entered the Baltimore house in
the afternoon, had scanned that same hand with a
jealous scrutiny, about two hours before, and it
was guiltless of rings—quite free—he could have
sworn to that. Was it possible that he had witnessed
the closing rites of their pre-conjugal union
from the top of the stairway? It was most likely.
For a moment the unhappy man felt a swinging
sensation, a kind of revolting nausea that put an
actual pain in his heart, and a sudden impulse almost
straightened him upon his legs, and would
have sent him flying from the house, seized him,
which only an indomitable Spartan furor of resistance,
in his English soul, could have conquered.</p>

<p>The next instant he, too, was smiling, even observing
with pleasant alacrity that when Brig
Barry raised his wine glass to his lips, his eyes
fell invitingly upon Sally, and that flattered fairy
responded by sipping from her own, not, indeed,
that such telegraphy of signals was obvious or unmannerly;
no! it required the jealous eyes of an
irritable rival to have seen it at all. It certainly
was a cruel ordeal. It certainly taxed Leacraft’s
self-possession. It was so fathomless and unexpected.
Not a word from Ned about it, and Sally had
always before appeared austerely impartial. Perhaps
it was a sudden fancy, an illusion, hopeless
on her part, because she could never marry her own
cousin. The Englishman rummaged painfully in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
his stock of conservative teachings to prove conclusively
that so abhorrent a social impropriety
could never be permitted. But there was the ring!
Well, a ring; what of it? A common gift; nothing
more. It was madness for him to jump at conclusions
so recklessly. Two cousins admiring each
other—yes, loving each other, in a beautiful, domestic
family way—and separated for a long time,
were naturally rejoicing in reunion. Stupid to
attribute so much as he had done, under so slight
provocation, to their mutual affection, the affection,
doubtless, of a brother and sister; keener indeed,
as why not?</p>

<p>Ruminating thus propitiously, and only half conscious
that he was going through the formalities of
a course dinner, and was but poorly assisting the
conversation, which consciously he thought had not
yet developed into any consecutive line of talk, he
suddenly seemed to come back to his senses, as these
words proceeded with celerous distinctness from
the lips of the older Garrett:</p>

<p>“A despatch was received in the office this afternoon,
about an hour ago, from Colon, which startled
us a good deal. Three earthquake shocks have been
felt in Colon, and an enormous tidal wave swept
over Limon Bay, in the direction of Mindi. There
was loss of life at Colon. The coast towards the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">embouchure</i> of the Chagres river has sunk sensibly,
and a rumor prevailed at Colon, at the time the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
despatch was sent, that the walls of the great Culebra
Cut had collapsed. This is bad news, if it is
true, bad news for the President, bad news for the
country. So enormous a disaster will be known
at once, if it to be known at all. The fact that no
press accounts have been given out makes me hope
that our despatch is a mistake, a canard, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the poor President!” exclaimed the sympathetic
Sally; “he will need his courage now. It
can’t be so horrible. They surely can’t mean,
papa, that the canal is destroyed. That would be
too shameful.”</p>

<p>“The operations of Nature,” said Ned Garrett,
“are not generally susceptible to shame. Nature
is about the most shameless thing on the face of the
earth,” and they all smiled at the thought.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Barry—and Leacraft watched
him with eager eyes, and listened with critical
ears—“Nature has a happy way of discriminating
between shame and compassion. She tries to make
up for her cruelties by some new blessing, but she
never tells anybody that her cruelties ever made her
blush. If this news is a portent of worse; if the
canal should be destroyed, if the isthmus is invaded
by the oceans, a canal without locks will be
given to us free of charge.”</p>

<p>“And we have spent one hundred and thirty million
dollars already. As a financial proposition, it
is hard to see why we have not paid as much for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
one as for the other,” dryly commented Mr. Garrett.
Leacraft felt it incumbent upon him to say
something, and his fatal over-valuation of seriousness
allured his tongue into a statement statistical
and scientific, something which might impress
Sally—but which only afflicted that young degenerate
person with an immoderate preference for
the way her cousin, Brig Barry, might have said
the same thing.</p>

<p>“I am rather curiously reminded,” began Leacraft,
“of a lecture which I heard in Washington
last April, in which the lecturer, Mr. Binn, ventured
to offer a very alarming prediction as to the
instability of the Central American zone, and especially
the portions of it embraced in the isthmus.
He was rebuked at the time in open meeting by a
Senator, but if your information turns out to be
correct, perhaps he is about to receive a stunning
corroboration. It would be of some psychological
interest to know whether Mr. Binn in that case preferred
his own reputation to his country’s welfare.”</p>

<p>“I heard of Binn’s talk,” remarked Brig
Barry. “I was near the Mexican line, and we had
had a brush with some greasers which were kicking
at Uncle Sam’s tariff. A Washington paper
turned up in camp, and there was Binn’s Jeremiad.
I think the paper had it ‘Science Butting
In,’” and, to Leacraft’s surprise, Sally laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>But a moment later she turned to Leacraft with
unaffected interest, and said, “But, Mr. Leacraft,
do you think Mr. Binn knew?” and her voice was
plaintive and concerned.</p>

<p>“It is reserved for astronomy,” said Mr. Garrett,
“to have prospective knowledge, to know the
future exactly, with a calendar in one hand, and
a watch in the other. I think it is not an imputation
on the credibility of science to say that in
other departments its knowledge of the future is
speculative.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Binn,” began Leacraft, “was not at all
didactic, as regards time, but he was emphatic in
the general scope of his predictions. He regarded
the Isthmus and the Central American area as belonging
in their geological habits to the West Indies,
and he had a very poor opinion of the fidelity
of the latter to implied obligations. He regarded
it as capricious and wayward, unsubstantial in its
composition, and a bit fickle in its attachments.”
It was almost impossible not to think that the
speaker was not putting a little bit of something
more than science in his words. He continued:
“His views also involved a curious reference to a
rather topsy turvy theory that the earth was pear-shaped,
and that the belt of earthquakes and
crustal disorders along the borders of the Pacific
resulted from this hypothetically crooked figure
of the earth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>Brig Barry was listening with intense attention,
and a whimsical glimmer of a smile turned the
ends of his lips, while his eyes very gravely, with
a slight contraction of their eyelids, watched Leacraft,
with half inquisitorial perplexity.</p>

<p>“I think,” he broke in, “that the West Indies
will manage to take care of themselves. At least,
present indications go to prove, that instead of
disappearing, they are on their way to bigger
things. Commander Beecham, who has just come
from the Isle of Pines, told me yesterday, that the
island was rising, that in a short time it might
become part of Cuba. The question might then
be asked, as we own the Isle of Pines, whether we
had not annexed Cuba.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of the Isle of Pines,” said Mrs.
Garrett, “but hardly understand what it is. Perhaps
a little enlightenment on the subject would
not be unwelcome to the rest of you.”</p>

<p>“Do, Brig,” pleaded Sally, “in the role of instructor
you may be as successful in geography as
in other subjects,” and Leacraft flushed and sat
back hard, to resist the harsh blow of this subtle
reminder of his worst suspicions.</p>

<p>Mr. Barry looked around, as if to secure the suffrages
of the company, and found every eye fixed
upon him in expectation. It was his turn to impress
Sally. He last looked at her, and as he did,
he laughingly began: “I shall have no compunctions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
in being a trifle the schoolmaster. The Isle
of Pines, Mrs. Garrett, lies in a deep bight or bay
near the south coast of the western part of Cuba.
There are some six hundred and thirty thousand
acres in it, and it is but ninety-nine square miles
less in extent than our little State of Rhode Island.
This island bears a sort of filial relation to Cuba.
It is part of the general chain of the insular mainlands
of the Antilles. It is not a coral key or a
mangrove swamp. It forms a plateau from fifty to
one hundred feet above sea level, broken by ridges
of hills or cliffs that start out over its surface like
the bones on the back of a thin cow.” Sally’s
deferential attention to Mr. Barry’s learning was
here interrupted by a very audible titter.</p>

<p>“I beg to remonstrate against any levity in my
class, and I think, Miss Garrett, you owe me an
apology for attempting to disturb my recital.”
This mock rebuke completed Sally’s disorder. Her
eyes, wet with tears of merriment, looked at Brig
Barry, who had assumed himself the amusing expression
of offended dignity, and she murmured,
“Excuse me, sir,” with such a delicious mockery
of piteous appeal that her father laughed aloud,
but Leacraft maintained his stern reserve, with
eyes uplifted from the face of his rival.</p>

<p>“Small as this island is, it offers room for two
mountain ridges at its northern end, which reach
the respectable elevation of fifteen hundred feet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
and are composed of limestones. There are other
ridges in the island, lower and less steep. The
whole island is surrounded by swamps, except towards
the south, where it is rocky. Commander
Beecham says that in the last month strange uplifts
have been noticed, almost unaccompanied by
any serious seismic—this last word, Miss Garrett,
may affect you unpleasantly; it means earthquake,—disturbance
and shoals and reefs are now bristling
out of the sea, like the teeth on a comb. And
another singular circumstance can be mentioned.
The island abounds in warm springs, curative—for
your benefit, Miss Garrett, I may say that the
word means healing—for rheumatism and throat
affections, and these springs are sinking; the water
seems to recede within the recesses of the earth,
while in other cases the subterranean channels
have either crushed together, or have become filled
up; the springs are simply not there; they have
vanished; the Commander has made observations
on the coast lines, and it seemed to him that they
were all rising. The Cuban coast is rising, too.
He came through Havana, and the shipways in
the harbor have become so shallow that there was a
gloomy prospect that the city would be cut off from
the sea. I only heard all this strange news an hour
ago, and I fear the excitement caused by meeting
Miss Garrett is to be held responsible for my forgetting
to mention it before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>The allusion was noticed by only Leacraft;
the next voice was that of Mr. Garrett, whose face
had darkened with apprehension. “Extraordinary!
It may be that our despatch is correct. It
may be that there is a sort of see-saw here, that
as the West Indies rise, the Central American
coast sinks. But why not a whisper of such occurrences
in the papers?”</p>

<p>“The see-saw fancy,” said Leacraft, now thoroughly
aroused, and forgetting his immediate disappointment
in the face of a formidable physical
phenomenon, “was Mr. Binn’s. He gave me the
feeling that he thought that, like an inflated surface,
where the higher elevation of one part meant
the lowering of another part, so the access of
height in the West Indies meant the loss of height
in the isthmus. And the provocation to any change
would be earthquakes.”</p>

<p>“As to the papers not publishing anything,”
explained Barry, “there are no newspaper correspondents
in the Isle of Pines, and I recall now
that Beecham told me that the authorities at Havana
were so frightened over the reports of the
harbor masters, that that they had prohibited their
circulation. The thing may prove grave enough.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope,” said Ned Garrett, “that such
rumors do not get abroad before to-morrow. They
are only half-proven assertions, based upon
some accidental and momentary circumstance. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
a few days the Isle of Pines may be the same as
it was, with the salt springs thrown in, and the
harbor of Havana back again to its old position
without so much as a jolt. The sea serpent is now
advancing towards our shores at the summer resorts,
why not a few nightmares from the tropics?
A truce to ghosts. Let us drink to the President
and the Canal.” The glasses were raised, their
lips, before they touched the sparkling lymphs,
offering, as if in silent prayer, to the consecration
of the beaded wine, unuttered hopes for the country’s
great head, and its great enterprise, had but
felt the amber current flowing from the engraved
chalices, musical with the tinkling of bits of ice,
when,—a sharp cry of voices, a babel of tumultuous
and precipitated outcries smote upon their
ears, entering the open windows like an execrable
assault. It was the shouting, thrilling with an unusual
impetus of omen, of the newsboys, as if they
had forgotten their mercantile relations to the
news, which, whether of joy or grief, they commonly
announce in the shrill yells of indifference
and gloating expectation. Now their multitudinous
voices mingled in a monstrous hoarseness, as
if constrained by a personal and immediate sorrow
and horror. Even ejaculations from men in
the streets buying the papers from the hawkers,
entered the room, and brought pallor to the cheeks
of the mute company. Ned Garrett pushed back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
his chair and sprang to the door, followed by Brig
Barry, and the rest stayed, immobile, like a stricken
throng, waiting the next minute for an impending
immolation.</p>

<p>Scarcely thirty seconds had elapsed when the
two men came back with the papers of the street,
one having the <i>Baltimore Times</i>, the other holding
in his hands the <i>Southern Herald</i>. The faces of
both men were pale, and on the cheeks of Ned
Garrett shone a trace of tears. Barry was the
first to enter the room, and as Mr. Garrett, now
standing at the head of the table, his body half
turned towards the door, his face suffused with
unchecked emotion—as Mr. Garrett said, “Well,
what is it?” he faltered, and dropping the paper
to his side, he faced the convulsed merchant, and
was silent. It was Ned Garrett who cried out,
“The Isthmus is crumbling to pieces and the Canal
is doomed.”</p>

<p>The order of events as we hear any sudden
stroke of affliction, as we suddenly confront the
inevitable bereavement, as we feel the sharp thrust
of calamity penetrate our hearts, varies with temperaments
and sex; but for the most part it reflects
the order of events under physical attack, the stunned
senses, and the reaction. It is in the reaction
that the difference among men most visibly appears.
Slowly Mrs. Garrett arose and left the room,
and Sally, after a pause, during which she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
stolen to the side of Brig Barry, and lifted the paper
from his side, where it had fallen in his unnerved
hands, followed her.</p>

<p>The four men were left behind, and of them only
Leacraft was seated. It was Leacraft who first
spoke: “This is awful, but the Nation is far greater
than any misfortune that can befall it.” The other
three turned to him with one accord, as if saved
from their own wretchedness, and moved in his
direction as if to embrace him. It was the right
word. It brought relief, and to one at least as he
turned his back to the speaker it brought tears. Mr.
Garrett the elder looked intensely at Leacraft, his
eyes almost glittering with the sudden joy of consolation,
and said, “Thank you, Mr. Leacraft, for
that true word. It is the one we need. You are an
Englishman, and your confidence in us is part of
your own Anglo-Saxon strength, and part of your
best knowledge that we are nourished by the same
blood. Let us sit down, and you, Brig,” (Ned Garret’s
back was still turned to them) “read the papers
to us. The first reports may be much exaggerated.”</p>

<p>Some servants had by this time collected in the
room at the side of the butler’s pantry and waited
there irresolute. Mrs. Garrett and Sally also softly
returned, and took their places at the table; with
them, as with Ned Garrett, the thought of the President’s
misery unnerved them. Barry had spread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
the paper before him. The dark head lines swept
across the sheet in ominous relief. They read:</p>

<p class="center p1 b1 vspace2 wspace smaller">
<span class="large">THE NATION’S LOSS.</span><br />

EARTHQUAKES AND LAND SUBSIDENCE ENGULF<br />
THE ISTHMUS AND THE CANAL.<br />

<span class="smcap larger">The Awful Cataclysm of Nature.</span><br />

THE PRESIDENT DEEPLY AFFECTED.<br />

THE MOST TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE IN MODERN TIMES.
</p>

<p>News from Aspinwall of the most appalling character
has been received in Washington, and though
an initial effort to conceal or suppress the despatches
was made, wiser councils prevailed and the
country will know the worst. America must now
vindicate her courage and maintain the reputation
she justly holds among the nations of the world for
self-reliance and self-control.</p>

<p>A long telegram received at the executive mansion
in Washington to-day was given to the country
by the orders of the President, after unavailing
remonstrances from the members of the cabinet,
who wanted the news withheld until confirmatory
despatches were received. It is believed that these
<em>were</em> received, and that the President ordered the
distribution of the news. In a word it announces
the destruction of the Canal, and the submergence
of the Canal zone, through a series of progressive
changes in the earth’s surface at that section, accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
by severe earthquake phenomena. The
confluent waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
will mingle over the buried structures of the Canal,
and one hundred and fifty millions of dollars, representing
the labor of three years, and nearly fifty
thousand men, with an enormous accumulation of
material, will have been spent in vain. The Nation’s
credit remains unimpeached and unimpeachable,
but the moral effects of this stupendous calamity
can scarcely be over-estimated.</p>

<h3>THE STORY IN DETAIL.</h3>

<p>A series of quickly succeeding earthquakes shook
the City of Panama on the evening of May 27th.
They were slight in character, though distinguished
by peculiar rotatory effects, turning natural objects
half way round, and producing curious effects upon
pedestrians who became dizzy under their influence.
These seemed to have passed inland and to have
accumulated in one severe shock at Miraflores, just
as a number of waves in water, chasing each other,
may combine to form a resultant wave higher than
its components, and generally, if the confluence
takes place in the right phase, of a height which is
the sum of the heights of the smaller elements.</p>

<p>At any rate, a most violent disturbance occurred
at the latter place, throwing down houses, and opening
hillsides, which was followed by an alarming
sinking of the ground. The railroad track disappeared,
part of the canal walls were swallowed up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
an immense influx of water from La Boca poured
in, and the former site of the village became a lake-like
expanse. No further shocks were felt, although
doubtless considerable dislocation farther west had
taken place, and the locks on the Canal beyond the
Culebra Cut, in the direction of Gamboa, San Pablo,
and Tavernilla were perhaps impaired. As if the
hidden energies of the earth had become reinforced,
and the subterranean fires had renewed their devastating
fury, on the morning of the 28th a sharp upheaval
of the ground at Tavernilla, in the old delta
plane of the Chagres river, took place, almost immediately
succeeded by as rapid a collapse and depression.
This alarming operation of the ground
was repeated, upon a titanic scale in the submerged
delta plane between Pena Blanca and Gatun. It was
reported that at first small monticules of rock, mud,
and sand, appeared in the vicinity of Agua Clara,
but these proved to be ephemeral elevations, subsiding
foot by foot, until with one monstrous convulsion
the whole ridge of hills between Limon Bay,
to the west on the Canal line, and Barrage at the
old French dam, slipped bodily into the sea, with
unutterable sounds, the rocks as it were exploding
with immeasurable violence. The discharge of the
mountain mass into the oceanic depths caused terrific
tidal waves to rush outward, and north and
south, in colossal walls of water. One of these
swept upon the panic-stricken inhabitants of Colon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
its solid phalanx suddenly approaching from
the sea, and in conjunction with earthquakes that
had emptied the houses of the horrified occupants,
bringing them all to the verge of madness, from
sheer fear. The skies, as if engaged in some hideous
conspiracy of destruction, with the moving
earth, suddenly darkened. Deluges of water poured
from the ebony and swollen clouds, lightning in
incessant lines of quivering brilliancy shot from
their lurid depths, and thunders intensified by a
thousand reverberations, shook the recesses of the
trembling hills.</p>

<p>It was not surprising that the spectators of these
monstrous happenings, with their earth vanishing
beneath their feet, the overcharged skies emptying
the arsenals of their electric fires upon them, and
the irresistible floods of the ocean, rising like avengers
to overwhelm them, should have cast reason
to the winds, and dumb with amazement, and insane
almost with horror, should have sunk upon
their knees, and waited for the engulfment, which
was to them part of this preternatural ending of
the world.</p>

<p>Few were strong enough to resist the frightful
strain, and the woods and hills near Colon were
filled with men and women in all states of frenzy.
Some with cowering limbs and bowed heads
awaited the summons of death or the call of
Judgment, while others, lost alike to reason and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
moderation, nakedly execrated Heaven, or, stark
mad, plunged weapons of defence into the bodies
of prostrate women.</p>

<p>A few engineers at Colon had hastily constructed
a camp on the higher hills towards the north, in
which they were imitated by engineers at other
points. These had communicated with the equipment
at Colon, and it was from the latter city, which
had at last accounts suffered little else than shocks
of varying violence, but not destructive, that the
first news had been sent.</p>

<h3>LATER ADVICES.</h3>

<p>From Allia Juela at an old dam station to the
north of Gamboa, in the hills, and on the water tributaries
of the Chagres, news has been just received
that the pertubations continue, and that the areas
about Aspinwall (Colon) are becoming progressively
invaded by the sudden sinking movements, and
the worst fears are entertained for the permanence
of all sections of the Canal. A telegram received
from Graytown, Nicaragua, announces the awakening
of the volcanoes of Costa Rica, especially Poas
and Irazu; steam and smoke are arising from other
previously dormant peaks, and ashes have fallen in
large amounts in the streets of Greytown. In an
interview with Mr. F. C. Nicholas, the well known
industrial prospector of Central America, that
authority says the zone of possible disturbance may
extend quite far, north and south of the Canal strip,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
though in his opinion the more disastrous results
may be expected in the mountainous and volcanic
chains along the old proposed route of the Nicaragua
inter-oceanic canal. He has himself felt the
tremors of the earth there and here ten or more
years ago his ear caught, so slight however that it
might have been only fancy, the faint rumbling of
the mountains as if in travail, which at the time was
interpreted by the guides as a premonition of storm.
Mr. Nicholas added at the close of his interview
that “when I left Colon after my visit to Nicaragua
common report had it that in Nicaragua there was
a valley of fire surrounded with blazing volcanoes,
and that I had seen it—a good example of Spanish-American
exaggeration. It may indeed now happen,
that this fanciful picture might, in even a more
extravagant and dreadful way, be realized, and the
long pent up forces of the earth, slumbering
through ages, become reawakened, with the most
disastrous consequences to the whole Central American
domain, through a contagious outbreak of volcanic
forces and terrestrial subsidences.”</p>

<p>Barry paused, and his eye travelled down the
page of the paper. He stopped and exclaimed:
“They’ve got wind of the things Beecham told me
about. Listen. ‘The Isle of Pines is rising, and in
the opinion of local authorities, the shoals at low
water between it and Cuba will afford an almost
unbroken transit to the greater island. The Windward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Passage between Cuba and Hayti has been invaded
by new reefs, and the Monas Passage between
San Domingo and Porto Rico is also reported
by sailing vessels recently arriving at Havana, to
present unusual and uncharted features, as if the
floor of the ocean was also there undergoing elevation.</p>

<p>“‘These marvellous modifications of the earth’s
surface seemed connected with renewed activity in
the volcanic islands of the Lesser Antilles. Mt. Pelee
is again reported to be in eruption on the island of
Martinique, while La Soufriere, on St. Vincent, is
in active eruption, and Dominica, Santa Lucia and
the Barbados have been visited by unprecedented
tides, which have been regarded as evidence of the
subsidence of the foundations of the islands themselves.</p>

<p>“‘We stand aghast before these incomprehensible
phenomena; our minds recoil before the
awful powers of the natural world; we stumble in
darkness at the meaning of this inscrutable visitation;
truly, we may recall the words of the psalmists:
<em>Then the channels of the waters were seen,
and the foundations of the world were discovered
at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath
of Thy nostrils.</em>’”</p>

<p>Barry ceased reading. He had read all the paper
contained. He turned mechanically to the sheet
Ned Garrett had laid on the table, and glanced over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
it, remarking—“it is the same”—and then there
was complete silence. It was Leacraft again who
helped to restore their composure; “I think,” he
said, “that in any event the water connexion between
the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans is assured.
Suppose the canal structure, as it was supposed to
be finally at its completion, is all swept away or
rendered impossible, an obviously easier access
from one ocean to the other is created. If a complete
change in the relations of land to water surfaces
is now in progress, if Mr. Binn’s disagreeable
predictions are now about to be realized, a good
many remarkable and not altogether regrettable
conditions may supervene. The water-way may
become a veritable strait, providing easy, unbroken
and capacious connexions between the Caribbean
Sea and the Pacific ocean—the islands of the West
Indies may slowly converge into one land surface,
and a new continent invite populations and industries,
which the wild, slothful or decadent peoples
of Central America, with their hot, fever laden and
deleterious climates, could not encourage or support.
We may be entering upon a new chapter in
the history of the world, and in the history of nations.
Who can tell upon what strange threshold
we are standing? Let us wait and see. Man is
subordinate to and the victim of circumstances.
Circumstance also gives him his opportunities.
What wonders may not the hand of God work in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
this marvellous reconstruction of land and water?
And if two hundred millions of dollars, as representing
the final cost of the Canal, seems to have
been swallowed up, what of it? A nation whose
annual appropriations—as I only read yesterday—are
on the scale of six hundred millions a year,
should regard with comparative complacence a loss
of one-third of that amount, when it arises from
a permanent and desirable change in physical, perhaps
human, conditions.”</p>

<p>As Leacraft was speaking, the little group of his
auditors remained motionless, with—it did not escape
Leacraft’s jealous notice—Sally and Brig at
its centre, in a sort of mutually consoling contact,
and the servants a little behind, in a scrutinizing
attitude, anxious through a sense of sympathy with
the evident distress of the household.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrett spoke, and Leacraft rose to his feet.
“We have indeed suffered a harsh blow, but it has
its after thoughts of alleviating hope, and you have
shown us that our alarm is more emotional than
substantial. The country has been fed upon the
proud anticipations of the accomplishment of this
Canal. It has become a political question. It has
colored the utterances of our public men. It has
been the dream of the President, as the crowning
work of a pre-eminent list of services to the nation.
His energy has pushed it to the verge of completion,
and in its prosecution the Nation and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
President have become united in positive endorsement.
It may all be right yet. Let us hope and
pray so.”</p>

<p>Flushed with real feeling, Mr. Garrett shook the
hand of Leacraft, and in a sort of review, the rest
imitated his example, and left the room, leaving
Ned and Leacraft behind.</p>

<p>It was then that Leacraft turned to Ned Garrett
and said: “I thought I saw an engagement ring on
the hand of your sister.” The statement was a
question. Ned Garrett looked at his friend with
singular intensity of interest and sympathy. He
realized the anguish of the man who, loving his
sister beyond all earthly price, forgot a country’s
peril in the eagerness of his hope that perhaps his
heart-breaking fears were unjustified. The two
men were standing. Ned Garrett took Leacraft’s
hand and placed his other hand upon his shoulder,
and his earnest face uttered its inviolable commiseration:
“Yes, Burney; Sally is engaged to Mr.
Barry.” They turned and left the room.</p>

<p>That night it was not the convulsions of nature
breaking down the barriers of two words, and
bringing into action new forces and new vicissitudes
among the peoples of the earth, that marred
the sleep of the restless Englishman. No; it was
the face of Sally Garrett smiling into the bending
face of Brig Barry, and touching his lips.</p>

<span class="subhead">GETTYSBURG, MAY 30TH, 1909.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Garrett party reached Gettysburg at mid-day,
May 30th, 1909, having passed through, in the
train from Baltimore, the delightfully rural scenes
of western Maryland and southern Pennsylvania.
Recent rains had swelled the brooks and expanded
the ponds. The wide undulations of hills and vales
were radiant in verdure, responding with the alacrity
of new vegetation to the encouragement of the
skies, that now in a broad arch of fleckless blue,
seemed to bend over them in pride and emulation.
A thousand pictures of loveliness, of homely domestic
bliss, of agricultural plenty, of bucolic
thrift and retirement, met their eyes, and Leacraft
himself found a solace to his grieved soul in resting
his eyes upon spots of soft and uninjured beauty,
wherein nature and the gentle craft of pastoral life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
combined their artless charms to make the landscape
serene and inviting to the eye.</p>

<p>It was almost with regret that they left the train
at Gettysburg. The noise or motion of the cars,
and the uninterrupted succession of pleasant views
from their windows had prevented conversation,
in which none of them, from preoccupation, or
from anxiety, from, in one person at least, sadness,
or from, in this case to be exact, two persons, extreme
happiness, cared to enter. And when
Gettysburg was itself finally encountered, they
found it in the last spasms of inordinate repletion.
The most exorbitant greed of guide and hackman,
guide-book man, publican and popcorn or peanut
vendor, was abashed before a popular consumption
that threatened to drive them into a confession of
impotency. Everything that had cubic capacity,
whether it moved or stood still, whether it was a
vehicle or a house, was aching under the intolerable
pressure of its human contents. Everywhere
clouds of flags decorated the air. The houses were
beribboned and beflagged, and innumerable lines
crossing the streets in a web of suspensory confusion,
carried pennants and pictures to the last limits
of their carrying capacity, and to the bewilderment
unutterable and admiration unrepressed of
the crowds beneath them. These crowds had become
almost stagnant because of the crowds in
front of them, and these in turn by reason of other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
crowds in front of them, until the successional torpor
seemed to reach out of sight, and presumably
ended in some greater peripheral crowd, which,
having attained its appointed place by choice or
selection, refused to budge. To make their way,
was almost impossible to the visitors, whether they
besought the services of a driver, or tried the painful
expedient of threading the human mass on foot.
In this extremity they simply remained where they
were at first arriving, hoping either the slow motion
of the democratic assemblage would afford
them some sort of escape, or at some critical moment
the vast throng would resolve itself into dispersion,
and under the influence of direction or
force, get itself better adjusted to the requirements
of its individuals.</p>

<p>Now, it was understood by all the published programmes
of that day’s exercises that the address of
the President was to be delivered at that historic
spot known as the High Water Mark, which marks
the uprushing tide, the foaming crest and insurmountable
limit of the Rebellion, which thereafter
receded in wavering surges to the south. In the
great reservation, devoted as a monument to the
battle which saved the Union, this spot is central,
and the acres stretched about it would accommodate
an army. It was quite inexplicable why this
annoying interference and congestion prevailed.
It turned out to be a military precaution. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
President was to be installed safely at the speaker’s
stand, escorted by veterans of the north and
south, before the people should be permitted to
assemble around him, and a cordon of military
enclosed the little village, keeping confined within
it the straining and impatient visitors.</p>

<p>The village of Gettysburg, which was used in
the great battle as a hospital, and which entirely
escaped injury in the three days’ conflict, was
more than a mile away from the place chosen for
the ceremonies of the day. When the dam was removed
it was seen there would be a dangerous
stampede for position. Music, too, swept exhilaratingly
over the throngs from the distant scene of
the festivities, and its martial notes awakened to
desperation the disappointed and vexed multitude.
The large numbers twisted and irksomely tied up
within the narrow streets, and turbulently mixed
up on the little square of the village, groaned
aloud.</p>

<p>Voices suddenly rose high in altercation and
abuse. A farmer whose rickety wagon, laden with
his sons and daughters, had got packed between
a curb and a particularly dense fragment of the
crowd, made up of vituperative young men, and
was in almost certain danger of being upset, was
engaged in a lusty expostulation not unassisted by
the quick and sharp lashes of his whip, over the
heads of the dodging group. The latter, not averse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
to some retaliatory measures that might serve the
purpose of freeing their general resentment at
their imprisonment, attacked the irate proprietor
of the wagon and pushed his shivering vehicle
over, spilling its screaming and swearing occupants
upon the heads of the bystanders, who were
utterly unable to escape, and added their din to the
commotion.</p>

<p>This diversion, attended with laughter, shouts
and cries of pain, had nearly subsided, when a new
and more alarming disorder arose in the neighborhood
of the Garrett party, who had betaken themselves
to the porch of one of the souvenir shops.
A wandering and aimless dog, suffering from
kicks and repulses, had turned on some of its persecutors,
and, yelping and snapping with inflamed
and frightened eyes, had suddenly been diagnosed,
by an inconsiderate observer, as “<em>mad</em>.” This
information, as usually, proclaimed in a loud, denunciatory
tone, raised in a second an indescribable
hubbub. Room to run from the bewildered canine
was not to be found, and the only thing to do for
those in the vicinity, was to squeeze more violently
against their companions, leaving a slender and
irregular space in which the dog gyrated,
biting at friend and foe alike. The undulous area
of movement thus formed swayed to and fro, with
the distracted struggles of the dog, and soon swung
violently towards the Garretts, who became rudely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
jolted and pressed by frantic men and women, in
whose legs apprehension of the dog’s teeth seemed
to have produced extraordinary motions, for they
shuffled and kicked and scrambled in a way very
undignified and ridiculous. The upshot of it was to
drive a frenzied pack of people towards the souvenir
shop, in the hope of entering the shop, and
evading the wretched canine somewhere beneath
their skirts and trousers—an absurd design, as the
shop itself was solid with condensed humanity.</p>

<p>Brig Barry saw the danger, and quickly hustling
Sally and Mrs. Garrett between the men of his party,
told all to stand firmly, after knitting their
arms within each other, forming an elastic and impenetrable
wall. As it was, the colliding tides
around them sent them on an unexpected orbit of
translation, and a few minutes later they found
themselves pushed towards the trolley tracks, not
far from the dishevelled and malign looking local
hotel, but in a less exposed and stormy quarter.</p>

<p>And now a marvellous change took place. The
barriers were down; the rolled up soldiers opened
the avenues of approach; the President, members
of his Cabinet, the Commissioners of the Reservation,
and the veterans of the North and the South,
were in place, and the delayed populace, released
from its confinement, with instantaneous expansion,
hurried over the roads and fields to the station of
the High Water Mark on Cemetery Ridge. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
a picturesque spectacle. When the condensation
was removed, it became apparent in how much
splendor the girls and women of the country and
the near and distant towns had been arrayed. They
came from Harrisburg, from Emittsburg, along the
fatal road that Longstreet’s rangers followed, from
Taneytown, from Hagerstown, where Lee’s army
had its rendezvous before the battle of Seminary
Ridge; from Chambersburg, which Ewell had dragooned;
from Wrightsville, where Early was
balked by the burning of the Susquehanna Bridge,
on the 29th of June; from Newville, from Hanover,
from Fairfield, the belles and beaux had gathered,
and with them no indifferent number of their fathers
and mothers. They wore their best ginghams,
and calicoes, and silks; the ancient trouseaus, refitted
and remade, still imparted the aspect of richness
to their wearers, who, ensconced beside their
furrowed and tanned husbands, also refurbished,
so to speak, with store clothes and a rainbow neck-tie,
felt the novelty of life return, and something
of the freshness of the glad morning of existence.
The girls were most happy and the boys voluble
and attentive. The caravan of vehicles would have
tasked the vocabulary of Tattersalls, though it was
not altogether so remarkable for the variety of its
contents as the indefinite suggestion of varied ages
in its parts. And here and there some time-worn
carryall creaking under the infliction of an unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
load, and drawn by some Rosinante, whose feeble
gait and frequent halts betokened a sad contemporaneity
with the vehicle itself, offered a pathetic
note in the hurrying splendor of the congregated
regalia of the barn and stable and garage.</p>

<p>The Garretts, once extricated from their embarrassed
position, armed with passports, one in the
hands of Brig Barry, and a special card in the
possession of Mr. Garrett, as guest of the Chamber
of Commerce of Baltimore, had little difficulty
in securing the essential indulgences for a delightful
day. In a three-seated coach wagon, with a
splendid team of horses, they bowled along as far
as the beginning of Hancock avenue, which leads
from the National Cemetery to the Round Tops.
Here they alighted and surveyed the wondrous
scene. It was resplendent. A sun burning with
the soft brilliancy of June bathed the grand distances
towards the Blue Hills in light, while the
Blue Hills themselves receded with artistic forbearance
behind an atmosphere that veiled them in an
evanescent purple and yet seemed to magnify their
height. The slopes of Cemetery Ridge were covered
by people, and the lower levels where the Codori
farm buildings stood; the Peach Orchard,
where Sickles and Longstreet met for the mastery;
the grain field beyond, over whose long stretches
Pickett’s charge was made, were filled with moving
groups. The distant woods, the nearer groves, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
grassy fields, Little and Big Round Top, all were
transfigured in the golden blaze, and the innumerable
monuments that gave the park-like Ridge a
sort of scenic artifice, seemed to become accordant,
in the vastness of the panorama, with its natural
and simple features. The farm lands, the white
houses, dotting fields, or emerging with human interest
from lines of shadowing trees, the peace of
the distant perspective, accorded a welcome contrast
to the foreground of the picture, immersed in
the waves of a popular assembly.</p>

<p>Automobiles flying like clouds rushed along the
far away roads, bicycles in undulating and streaming
lines, grew large with rapid approach; the
gathering spots of people merged together and became
irregular squares, the squares united and became
tracts, and the tracts, by an incessant accretion,
coincided along their edges until Cemetery
Ridge, the slopes towards Little Round Top and the
field below the “angle,” where Cushing and Armistead
died, were unbrokenly covered with the vast
congregation, pulsating ceaselessly by an interior
agitation everywhere.</p>

<p>The heterogeneous assortment of conveyances
were halted near the National Cemetery, and the
people made their way to the enclosure, where the
President was to address them, along the triumphal
monument-enfiladed boulevard of Hancock
avenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>The Garrett party had noticed the earnestness
and apparent preoccupation of the people. The
news of the previous night had spread its sinister
announcements through the papers of the country,
carried to every village on the myriad fingered
currents of the telegraph. It had left its impress
in the serious, sombre and sometimes dully
frowned faces of the men. “I feel sorry for the
President,” said Sally. “The Canal seemed
almost himself, and the people thought of it and
him together. What will he do?”</p>

<p>“The President,” answered Ned Garrett, “will
not flinch. Ever since he went down to the Isthmus
in 1906, and made the dirt fly, he has watched
the Canal with his whole heart in it. He knew
what it meant for the country, for the world, and
now”—the speaker hesitated—“he will know what
to say and do. How I believe in that man!”</p>

<p>“But I can’t see,” continued Brig Barry, “that
the idea of the Canal is lost. Let us suppose there
is a shifting and readjustment down there. The
two oceans are left behind, not much different, and
if the isthmus breaks down, splits up, and goes to
thunder, there’s water enough to cover the remains,
and we have the Canal anyway.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t our Canal any more,” ejaculated
Sally. “It seems,” said Mr. Garrett, “as if our
grief had been premature. There is enough to
worry over in this frightful catastrophe, and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
limits no one to-day can correctly estimate, but as
Brig says, the Canal idea is saved, or at least it
seems reasonable to believe that it may be. If Nature
makes a bigger canal, if she changes the face
of the earth enough, as Leacraft told us last night,
to unite the oceans and make a strait, the commercial
union of the western and eastern continents
is secured on a larger scale. Perhaps our national
pride must suffer some, but the fact remains,
though, it would have saved our exchequer a handsome
outlay, if nature, consulting our financial happiness,
had done her work a little earlier.”</p>

<p>“If we’d only waited,” sighed Mrs. Garrett,
ruefully.</p>

<p>They had reached the edges of the throngs who
stood in the sun, engrossing every coigne of vantage,
and an orderly, examining their tickets, conducted
them through a narrow lane of envious gazers
to a stand of seats to the south of the President’s
rostrum. From this position their eyes fell directly
upon the amazing outpouring of the people,
an ocean of individuals, hopelessly cancelled from
any chance to hear the President’s voice, yet extending
outward in a solemn silence, and but furtively
invaded by those busy concomitants of such
public gatherings—button men and popcorn merchants.
For the most part such annoyances were
inordinately thrust aside, but scurrying over the
most distant outposts of the mammoth audience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
their eager shapes were seen, and inconstantly,
borne inward by the breeze, the shrill invitation of
their voices was heard.</p>

<p>Leacraft fixed his eyes upon the President, and
he was near enough to him to note his expression.
President Roosevelt sat squarely facing the people—now
crushing in with an irresistible impulse
from the distributed masses before him. He
seemed serious, at moments almost solemnly so,
at others he turned to his companions with alacrity,
and his face even smiled at some allusion or
whispered comment. Again his eyes wandered
dreamily—Leacraft thought sadly—to his notes,
and then he moved restlessly and leaned forward,
and even half rose, eagerly scanning the expectant
faces. A jumping up of half a dozen men at the
rear of the platform, a signal of a waved handkerchief,
followed, and the band, stationed somewhere
behind the distinguished occupants of the platform,
began the Star Spangled Banner. Everyone not
already standing rose, heads even uncovered, and
the spirited strains seized by the concourse, were
flung back in a torrent of vocality, that sounded
like the far and near thunder of the ocean’s surges.
It was overwhelming. As if before the spirit of the
Nation, the living and the dead; those whose discarnate
beings might seem rushing in upon them
from the viewless depths of space, summoned again
to the fields of their endeavor by the marshall air,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
hats were doffed in all directions, until scarcely a
covered head among the men remained, and many
eyes streamed with irrepressible tears. The note
of a requiem, the prouder challenge of defiance, the
lofty questioning of Hope, the loving clasp of fraternal
patriotism, the aspirations of a race, solving
“in the foremost files of time” the problem of the
world’s political creed, seemed blended together,
in the avalanche of sound. And it was maintained
to the end, even the verses of the national anthem
were well remembered, and that trying and unattainable
high note, like the scream of the eagle,
which closes the lips of most singers in dubious
apathy, was now sustained. The President sang
lustily, and then he stopped, his head bowed; he
might have been in prayer. It was noticed by all
and it almost seemed as if the music quailed and
sank before the mystery of a man’s outpoured petition
to his God.</p>

<p>It was over. The music ceased, the frail voice
of the chairman sounded its quavering invitation
to prayer, and a clergyman arose and droned an
invocation. The President was introduced and
stood forward. He was well in view. One hand
grasped the railing before him, the other clutched
some separated papers, he looked well and the
man’s vitality, his zealous unmitigated self exaction
were realized. As he was seen, the tumult rose
to a tremendous climax, cheers rolled forward and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
backward like the fluctuating billows of a sea; they
receded to the outer margins far toward the
Hagerstown road, where they vanished in murmurs,
they crashed inward in volleying thunders,
and the President stood erect, nerved to a steel-like
rigidity; the air was swept with flags, the intoxication
of the emotion increased, women palled before
it, and men grew pale with the delirium of sudden
enthusiasm. It seemed as if music alone could lead
them back into the resignation of attention. It was
a stupendous tribute. The man to whom it was
given, had no reason for misgiving, no retributive
judgments for his actions, to dread. Slowly, very
slowly the cheering and cries died away, and then
ensued a silence as remarkable and as impressive.
The two contrasted states of the multitude might
have been interpreted as a generous invitation to
the man to speak, and as a judicial reservation of
mind as to its own verdict when he had spoken. It
almost seemed so, and the quick heart of the President
might again have felt the palpitation of a
doubt, whether he stood approved, or a critical people
withdrew into the refuge of an impartial scrutiny.
Leacraft felt all this, and he could not help
also feeling a curious interest in the purely psychological
enigma it presented.</p>

<p>The President was speaking; his voice reached
Leacraft thin and sharp:</p>

<p>“My friends,” he began, “To-day we celebrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
again the brave deaths of brave men, and the sacrifices
they made for the maintenance of our common
country. And we are gathered together on the
battlefield which more than any other battlefield
in that historic war, represented the culminating
energies of both sides, the last vital contention for
the mastery. These men left behind them the inestimable
example of fortitude. And after the battle
of Gettysburg it was more difficult for the southern
man to continue the fight, in the face of disaster,
with a depleted country behind him, and a foe
flushed with victory, and drawing upon almost
illimitable resources, than for his northern brother,
for whom at last the tide of war seemed to have
turned. We to-day need the lesson of this fortitude
of the man in gray.</p>

<p>“My friends, a disaster has overtaken us,”—the
crowd before the President seemed to compress itself
in a further effort to get closer to him, “and it
is our duty to remain firm and unfalteringly confident.
I can scarcely doubt that you all have
heard that nature has destroyed the Nation’s work.
The face of the earth at the Isthmus of Panama is
altered. Our work, our expenditures, the lives of
thousands of hard working men have been sacrificed,
and we stand aghast before a natural revolution
unequaled in our day, unparalled perhaps in
all the annals of history; something which in its
wide devastating power, crushes our pride, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
for a moment makes us cease to think, to plan, to
build. I come to you this morning with strange tidings—tidings
so unspeakably great in their influence
upon our knowledge, that I almost hesitate to
pronounce them, lest I might find myself the victim
of some horrible and wicked hoax. The Isthmus
of Panama, from Quibo Island in Montijo Bay, on
the west, to the confines of the valley of the Atrato
River at the edge of the Columbia, on the east, is
deviously, here with a regular movement of depression,
in another place with violent shock, sinking
beneath the waters of the opposite encroaching
oceans that swings backward and forward on either
side in awful tidal deluges.</p>

<p>“The latest news confirms all the previous reports.
Slowly, surely, even with hastening steps,
the narrow neck of Panama, with its shallow shores,
its long exposure of swamp and mud flats, with its
crumbling hills, covered with tropical life will be
engulfed, and the two continents of North and
South America will return to a pristine condition of
geographical autonomy. It is hard to believe. I
cannot recount to you the wonderful pictures, terror-inspiring,
and yet majestic with the majesty of
Nature’s awful deeds, which have been sent to us.
The loss of life has been considerable, but not proportionate
to the stupendous agencies involved. After
the first earthquake upheavals, the quickly succeeding
disappearance of the solid ground furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
an adequate warning, and the populations along
the canal-way at the villages and camps, and at Aspinwall
and Panama, retreated to the hills, and with
them the animal life, in a singular copartnership of
fear. It is now regarded as certain, that we are
about to see the last vestiges of the canal itself, the
work of these last four years disappearing in the
folding in and submergence of the rock strata.”</p>

<p>The President then told the story of the catastrophe
as it had been narrated in the despatches received
at the White House. He painted in graphic
words the shaking down of the hills, the dislodged
blankets slipping from the hill sides like a shawl
from a shuddering woman, carrying with them the
crashing trees, the jungle growth, the entwined tendrilous
creepers and vines, while above the trees,
swaying toward each other and then outward as if
following the crests and troughs of hidden waves,
above these tottering trees, the birds in screaming
volleys rose and fell. The bared rocks showed
rents, and tremendous explosions sent their shattered
fragments into the air, while long weird
groans issued from the ground as if the buried
foundations of the hills were undergoing the tortures
of mutilation. In other places it had been
quite different. The ground slowly seemed to melt
away, and with a sort of shuddering succession of
chills the land disappears. How long, how much
further this swallowing up of the land will go no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
one can tell. But it has seemed to those who have
some knowledge of the region that it may embrace
the S shaped Isthmus only, and that the tapering
ends of the bulwarks of elevation in the Rocky
Mountain chain on the north, and the Andes on the
south will resist this degradation, that Costa Rica
on the north and Columbia on the south will rudely
define the north and south edges of the new avenue
or gateway of unions between the oceans, that the
new canal in this way, reconstructed by the titanic
convulsions of nature, will become a wide and useful
passage for commerce.</p>

<p>The President indulged the evident curiosity of
his popular audience in a scientific discourse. His
own interest was evident. He discussed earthquakes;
he plunged into an essay on volcanoes; he
spread luminously before the people the theories of
the pear-shaped earth, the slipping of faults, the
loading of the earth’s crust, the original formation
of the deep creases in the earth’s surface, which
now held its gathered waters. The President made
a model expositor. He was clear and interesting.
His style, his illustrative similes were attractive
and deliberately helpful. It was almost amusing to
note the contrasted effect of this improvised academic
demonstration upon the people and upon the
political sages of the platform. The former were
attentive and absorbed. Their faces lit up with the
quiet pleasure of intelligent appreciation, frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
at some pungent expression that pictured
to them in stirring forcible photographic phrase
the stifling struggle of land and water, the fierce
unrest far down there in the tropics, which was unsettling
the foundations of the earth, and slowly
establishing a new order of things, pregnant with
revolution in the day and fate of nations, carrying
in its geological material insensate womb of meaning
the dissolution of states, the upset and consternation
of rulers, a menace to civilization, the ruthless
unwavering threat to human accidents and institutions.</p>

<p>To all this the political magnates listened with
bored indifference. They expected a party appeal,
some appetizing bid for popular suffrage, a shot
at the South, a resounding puff for the Republican
candidates, a public acknowledgement of their personal
industry in securing the re-election of himself,
new projects of expenditure, and a programme
of national expansion. They turned and twisted,
and some deliberately slept or engaged in low
conversations with an expressive irony of shrugs
and smiles.</p>

<p>The President paused, his hands came together,
and he leaned far forward, and a moment’s hesitancy
marked the termination of his scientific periods.
He continued, with sudden earnestness and
vigour, with almost self-surrender to the impetus
of his thought: “My friends, these are the facts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
and no lamentations can change them. We must
learn from the courage and devotion of the men
who left this field defeated, to face this new predicament,
not with resignation, simply, but with the
constructive determination to seize this new turn in
events and force it into our service, to make it only
a more complete realization of our first designs.
This is the triumph of Opportunity. Thus shall we
wrest from the confusion of chance its empire of
the fitting moment, and drive its scattered impulses
into the straight, the narrow path of our strictest
needs. The canal as a commercial necessity cannot
be eclipsed or abandoned. The original project is
replaced. Replaced by something greater, more
permanent, more cosmopolitan. It becomes no
longer a provincial fact, a national asset simply. It
is a feature of the earth.</p>

<p>“What exactly has happened, how complete is
the transformation no one exactly knows, but if the
assistance of engineering is still to be invoked it can
only be in a way of a help to nature. The facts
remain.</p>

<p>“And now my friends a stranger possibility
confronts us, nay it lifts up a sinister and awful,
an ominous portent for the leading nations of the
world. It seems likely that this physical alteration
may mean a change in the climate of the older portion
of the earth.”</p>

<p>Again the President launched into a scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
lecture and he was fortunate, as at first, as alertly
careful, as broadly popular, as adroitly technical,
without obscurity. It was well received. And its
conclusion was altogether wonderful. Leacraft
had good reason to listen with all his ears.</p>

<p>The President described the contrasted temperatures
of similar latitudes in Europe and America,
how England on the latitude of Labrador was warmer
than New York which found its Adirondack
mountains—chilled in the depth of winter to almost
forty degrees below zero—on the same degree as
southern France; itself the type and synonym of
warmth. He made it clear how the thermal flood
of warm waters upon the shores of Europe—heating
the drifting airs above it till, laden with moisture,
they too added their gifts of rain and warmth
to Great Britain, and the shores of Scandinavia;
how this Gulf Stream, a wayward impressionable
wandering river pushing past Florida with a cubic
capacity of seven hundred thousand cubic feet of
water in half a second of time, and, held in its fluctuating
course by the laws of gravity, how this marvellous
oceanic flood, controlled the material conditions
of England’s greatness; grasped, as it were,
in the filmy fingers of its webbed and spreading
tides, its wealth, its maritime supremacy, its intellectual
distinction, its domestic thrift, and sunny
sweetness. And then the President ended, and
Leacraft bent forward, gripped the railing before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
him with sudden fierceness, a knell strangely appalling
sounded in his ears, a portent widely distracting
and unreasonable drove the color from his
cheeks.</p>

<p>The President ended with these words: “The
Gulf Stream whipped into violent activity by the
south east trade winds beats impetuously upon the
islands of the West Indies, washes the beaches of
Central America, and whirls its spinning tides
within the Gulf of Mexico, and then, repulsed by
the continuous shore lines of North America,
returns to Europe bearing its mantle of verdure
to be thrown over the hills, the capes, the valleys
the western edges and islands of the Old World.
But now the barrier is gone. The Gulf Stream
before the strong and rapacious winds is no longer
turned aside by impossible walls of land but triumphantly
sweeps into the Pacific, and with it vanishes
the glory of England. For ourselves it means
singular disaster though it may bring compensating
changes. If England disappears as a world
power we are robbed of a friend, we have lost a
market. What words shall measure the moral
meaning of the first, what revenues express the
yearly increasing value of the latter. We stand
on the threshold of a New Era.”</p>

<p>The termination of this remarkable address was
its most momentous and unexpected announcement.
As the President sat down, there was no applause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
just a ripple of clapping hands as a half-hearted
recognition of an invariable habit. The speech had
been utterly robbed of political significance, despoiled
of rhetorical or personal emphasis, it failed
entirely as the usual thing in public oratory, and it
left behind it an oppressive sense of impending
changes. The President seemed depressed by his
own vaticinations, and those around him, chilled
into anxious forebodings, sat stiffly silent and
unresponsive. The moment was saved from intolerable
embarrassment by the band.</p>

<p>The leader stepped forward, waved his baton
and the solemn strains of America—the transplanted
hymn of England—rose plaintively, like a
prayer; to Leacraft it sounded like encouragement,
like sympathy. Someone began to sing—hats
came off, the guests rose, and the multitude
sang. If the Star Spangled Banner had been exultant
and triumphant, thronged with the memories
of achievement and victory—America
throbbed with supplication, and underneath the
supplication, the fervor of allegiance, sacrifice and
love. The peculiar awkwardness of an unusual, an
unique predicament, was removed. The speakers
following the President made no allusion to the
Canal, and all the marvellous happenings far away
in Central America. They led the people’s thought
back again to the soil they stood upon, to the memories
of a glorious past, to the hopes of the future,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
the realization of the present tasks, the reiteration
of the nation’s wealth and happiness, its strength
under misfortune, its illimitable resources. They
were successful. The pall of misgivings which the
President had invoked was lifted. The band broke
out again with reassuring liveliness, and good humour
and holiday satisfaction revived.</p>

<p>Then came a procession through the Reservation
to Big Round Top and back again on the lower
ground past the Devil’s Den, and over the Emmetsburg
road to Gettysburg, and in the clamorous excitement,
the parade of uniforms, the brilliant atmosphere,
congratulations and convivial indulgence,
all the President’s words became clouded
and unreal. And if the Isthmus was covered by
water, if the Gulf Stream was deflected, if it meant
blight for England, what of it? The United States
would only become greater—its magnification
would be unquestioned, boundless; the stars in
their courses worked for them, and the mutations of
the earth’s surface only brought to them unrivalled
aptitudes for new chances, for new power.</p>

<p>This was said a good many times by a good many
kinds of men, and the intangible something it suggested,
by repetition, assumed the force of demonstration.
There was a distinguishable forgetfulness
of the disasters that had come, and a listless
thought of those that were threatened. A few observant
and reflecting minds brooded over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
strange catastrophe, and yielded an attention to
their implications. This attitude sprang from
knowledge, and in the case of Leacraft from a personal
interest in the singular sequence of events
which the President portrayed, and which even the
placidity of an Englishman’s confidence in his destiny
failed to contemplate as injurious fiction. It
was a thing to be reflected upon, at least, and added
its sombre influence to deepen the gloom of Leacraft’s
disappointment. But it also gradually developed
for him a remedial efficacy, not simply as
a spurious employment for his thoughts, but
through a substantial relevancy to his emotional
needs.</p>

<p>Leacraft’s mental inclinations carried him towards
speculative forecasts. He had cultivated his
predilections along all sorts of scientific horoscopes,
and had enjoyed the indulgence of his fancy in
studying nations and inventions, with a view to
composing a plan or description of their future
condition, phase and expression. He had arrived
at some curious results, but they represented solely
the changed surface of society, in its industrial,
civic or social states, or else, in their more immaterial
flights, pictured the enduring alterations of
religious or philosophic systems. In all these speculations
he had quite neglected the physical constants
of the world, its climate and topography.
His thought engaged itself with the mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
structure of civilization, as affected by new discoveries,
allied with an increasing utilitarianism, in
which the individual vanishes before the imperious
supervention of the State, the incorporated multitude,
the abstract Wisdom of the most knowing
minds, influenced by a solicitous paternalism for
the Whole.</p>

<p>But now he found himself confronted by a new
exigency, the geological interferences of Nature,
and it piqued his curiosity, it assailed his fancy
with indubitable fascination. By reason of his intellectual
proneness to these questions, which quite
deeply occupied his mind, he felt at this moment
that the tremendous and supreme chance of his
own mighty nation, succumbing to the accidents
of a tidal caprice might offer him an alternative
refuge of interest which would help to dull
the pain of his misfortune. So convulsing a spectacle
as the pitiless war of nature upon the embedded
bulwarks of a great commercial nation’s
prosperity, terrified him as a possible historical
fact. Above all, it terrified him as a British subject.
It became so overwhelming in the magnitude
of its effects that he shudderingly admitted to himself
that his love for Sally suffered a relieving
diminution, as though in such events the End of the
World seemed precipitated, and all human ties became
obliterated, were dissolved.</p>

<p>The day closed in resplendent beauty. The sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
curtained in a haze, shed a diffused glory through
the upper sky, and sank at last in a grating of
narrow bars of cloud, that lay across the west like
reefs of gold, slowly transmuted into a purple nimbus
upon the faintly turquoised ether. The great
crowds dispersed, the troops escorted the President
away, and music from near and far seemed to mingle
dreamily with the mute harmonies of the sunset.</p>

<p>The Garretts, with Mr. Leacraft and Brig Barry,
returned that night by train to Baltimore. The
night proved a sleepless and excited one for Leacraft.
He felt ill at ease. There was much reason
for uneasiness and heartache, and the hours passed
in a dull series of mournful reflections upon his
own trouble, and the immodest threat of nature at
the prestige of his people.</p>

<p>The next morning he entered the library and
found Miss Garrett bending over the morning paper.
She looked up as he appeared in the doorway,
and there was for both a moment’s hesitation,
before the morning’s greeting passed their lips. It
was Sally who first spoke, and her voice was eager
with alarm.</p>

<p>“Mr. Leacraft, the President’s lecture—surely,
it was nothing else—is all here. And there is more
news from the Isthmus. The land is sinking, all
sinking, and”—she turned to the paper—“almost
all the canal has now disappeared beneath the assault
of the waves, and a stormy waste of waters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
sweeps across the Isthmus of Panama. Isn’t it
simply fearful? And nothing can be done.”</p>

<p>“Miss Garrett,” answered Leacraft slowly, his
eyes sadly resting upon her face, grown more
beautiful, he thought, by the dwelling of a tender
fearfulness in her eyes, “it is a fearful thing; an
occurrence such as this is a pretty sharp shock to
our sense of security. I can’t forget the President’s
words. As an Englishman I really contemplate
coming events with a positive terror. But there is
something else, Miss Sally, I beg to speak about,
another sorrow for me, though I must not permit
my selfish regret to cloud your happiness.”</p>

<p>Sally Garrett came quite close to Leacraft. She
had a true estimate of his strong and dignified nature;
she yielded the just homage of affectionate
regard, but her heart had never been moved by the
Englishman’s impressive seriousness. Leacraft
was about to speak again when voices were heard
approaching, and among them the vigorous intonations
of Brig Barry. Leacraft stopped, and a shadow
of suffering crossed his pale face. Sally understood
too clearly. She put out her hand and seized
his, and pressed it kindly, and Leacraft understood
her sympathy.</p>

<p>Brig and Ned Garrett came into the room, and
soon the discussion of the strange events taking
place at the Isthmus occupied the group, to which
in a few minutes Mr. and Mrs. Garrett were added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>Leacraft shortened his visit under the pretext
of an engagement in New York, and it was years after
that he again saw Miss Sally Garrett—then become
Mrs. Brig Barry—after the stupendous facts
on the following pages had made the Kingdom of
Great Britain part of the Frozen North.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EVICTION OF SCOTLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Alexander Leacraft was standing at a window
in the upper story of the Caledonia Railroad station
in Edinburgh, November 28th, 1909, and was
gazing with fixed and tormented eyes upon an unusual
scene. The sky beyond Carlton Hill was
leaden grey with the blear dullness of a snow-laden
atmosphere, and a singular and menacing
bar of half-eclipsed red light, like a cooling bar of
incandescent iron, shone with irregular palpitations
through the descending sheets of snow. It
was a strange and appalling picture. Already a
week’s precipitation had filled up the deep moat of
the Princes’ street gardens, choked up the tracks
of the North British Railroad, mounded the ragged
edges and wandering parapets of the Citadel, until
its outlines were effaced in a colossal accumulation,
like a titanic snowball, and a long incline of spotless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
snow sloped to St. Cuthbert’s Church, itself half
buried in the powdery blanket. The blurred lineaments
of Calton Hill, so familiar and so beloved
by Scotchmen, were uncertainly descried, the Nelson
monument, the unfinished peristyle, the mediaeval
ranges of the penitentiary, the cheese box summit
of the observatory (already the large group of
buildings on the Pentland Hills had disappeared
from sight), and the classic sombreness of the college
fascade. Had Leacraft been near at hand, he
would have seen that the monument to Scott—the
tribute to one fame by the aspiring genius of another,
dead before fame had quite enrolled him in
her categories—was deeply buried, and that the inclined
head of the Wizard was quickly vanishing
under the piled up pillows of billowy snow.</p>

<p>Alexander held a field-glass in his hand; the
window at which he stood was open, and the snow
blowing in upon it had raised a mound about his
feet. The observer was, however, oblivious to this
invasion; he leaned far out, and turned his inspection
from point to point with rapid movements and
obvious anxiety. A curious thing was happening
immediately below him, and astonished him. In the
leafless branches of the churchyard trees had gathered
a vast concourse of crows, and the black-feathered
congress was being momentarily augmented
by new arrivals streaming in from all quarters,
too evidently dislodged from more natural and habitual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
resorts. Their discordant cries seemed a
melancholy symbol of doom. An awful silence
otherwise possessed the Athens of the North. It
was practically a deserted city, and its desertion
was only part of a widespread calamity which now
had begun the shocking chapter of national eviction.</p>

<p>The usual hum and bustle of the streets had gone;
the tramcars no longer trundled through its streets,
and a half-hearted effort to make a path along the
centre of Princes street accommodated a few distracted
pedestrians and official retainers, yet unwilling
to join the army of migration which had
slowly moved away from a city, that the pitiless
rigor of a new dispensation in climate had doomed
to a wintry burial.</p>

<p>Alexander Leacraft himself awaited reluctantly
the departure of a train of emergency which was expected
to carry away the last remnants of Edinburgh’s
population. He had come to the unfortunate
city freighted with misgivings, when the news
reached London—itself experiencing peculiar vicissitudes—of
the terrifying severity and earliness of
the winter in Scotland. He recalled his forebodings,
which the President’s speech had awakened, though
the later reports of the complete reversal of the
Gulf Stream into the Pacific, and the accomplished
destruction of the Central American Neck of land
had already stirred the scientific minds of England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
to the utterance of half-hearted warnings.</p>

<p>The matter had now suddenly loomed up into
a frightful reality, and the devastating storms
sweeping out of the black heart of the north, had
brought Scotland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland
into a common fate of extinction. The sheltering
power of the Gulf Stream was removed from Great
Britain, and the frost of the Arctic world, so long
repulsed, but now no longer compressed within the
Arctic circle, expanded with instantaneous certainty,
spreading the shroud of its killing cold over the
same latitudes in Europe that for ages had slept
beneath its spell in America.</p>

<p>The population in part of the north of Scotland
had escaped by means of ships to other countries or
to southern England. Many villages, isolated
houses, and remote districts had suffered cruel
hardships, and the entombed bodies of thousands of
families waited for a recovery which perhaps only
in ages “yet unborn” could come to them. The
white burden of snow mantled the valleys and hillsides
of Scotland, the higher hills of the Trossachs,
and the Grampians, the defiant crest of Goat Fells
in Arran, and the twin peaks of the Island of the
Holy Mount. Enormous drifts had risen in white
waves almost to the summit of Bruce’s monument
at Sterling, and the old Abbey of Cambuskenneth
had disappeared. Ice of great thickness prevailed
in the Clyde, and the movement of the tides had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
forced it up in threatening hummocks upon the
drab stone cottages and villas of Greenock and
Gourock. From Aberdeen to Leith the cities had
been slowly deserted, after desperate efforts to free
them from their entombment. The trains going
south to England were loaded with the rich contents
of mansions and summer castles; agonizing
scenes had been witnessed at a thousand points
where the heart-broken people sadly turned their
backs upon all they had, and all they loved and
knew. Heroic rescues were as numerous as the
occasions demanding courage and inflexible daring
had been frequent. Throughout Great Britain the
trembling soul of the nation shrunk upon itself
with a nameless dread, as it suddenly found its existence
confronted with the inexorable processes
of nature, when the appalling and relentless squadrons
of the Ice King, with vengeful speed, issued
in all the fierce panoply of wind and hideous life-killing
cold, from the last tenements of their abode,
to slay a prosperous and proud people.</p>

<p>Europe felt a sickening doubt as to the permanence
of its life and works, and the autumn brought
the shrewd and eager fingers of the cold into the
streets and houses of Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne,
Antwerp, Amsterdam, Ostend, Havre and even
Paris. Attention to the vaticinations of science
was mingled with the prophetic denunciations of
religious frenzy. Pallor marked the features of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the rulers of the people, and speechless stupor had
seized the common people, who looked to the skies
in pitiful confidence that their misery and desolation
would touch the heart of that inscrutable Providence,
who, reigning beyond the stars, held the
reins of the winds and the bit of the frost in his
multitudinous omniscience.</p>

<p>But in England, and especially in Scotland, at
the opening of the dreadful winter, the precipitation
of snow had attained monstrous proportions.
For four weeks the vault of the skies had been thick
with falling clouds of snow.</p>

<p>Leacraft left the window and descended the solitary
halls, no longer swept by groups of tourists,
to the street. A broken crease in the snow banks
offered him a precarious access to Princes’ street.
It appeared almost obliterated in places, at others
it seemed a narrow slit between threatening walls
of snow, that almost toppled over it, while blinding
storms of fine particles, hissing over the undulous
surface above, at times poured into the compressed
chasm, filling it up many feet in a second of time.
Abandoned cars, stalled one behind each other, for
a block, both on Princes’ street and under the Castle,
in the Lothian road, had become the refuge
of the workers, and some were made into improvised
hospitals and camps. A few relics, half-starved,
and fainting with fatigue and exposure,
were being treated with rough consideration in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
these accidental retreats, which, buried under snow,
resembled caves, the feeble light of oil lamps and
candles yielding a flickering illumination through
the dull chill gloom within them.</p>

<p>Leacraft made his way with difficulty to Princes’
street, and groped along the aisle that cut the
street in two. Here he discovered a phalanx of
men with sledges and mallets, who, by dint of passing
to and fro, without clearing away the snow,
were compressing it into a sort of solidity that
gave a firm footing. With the continuous fall of
snow, and the abrupt windfalls of snow drifting
into the cut this path was rapidly rising, and was
also most irregular in its outlines. At some points
it rose high enough to permit anyone walking on it
to see above the adjoining banks of snow. One of
these elevations was directly opposite Hanover
street, along which formerly ran the cars to the
Botanic gardens. Leacraft had reached this spot
and stood an instant upon the commanding back of
pounded snow, looking with amazement upon the
silent waste around him, the sunken gardens to the
south marked by a wide superficial depression, with
their terraces on either side outlined in shoulders of
white. To the north, up the low hill that culminated
in George street, he saw the houses on either
side buried as high as their second stories in the
snow, from which their attic stories emerged like
titanic gravestones. The statue of George IV. had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
become the centre of a rotating whirl of snow that
kept the nether limbs of that potentate from the
encroaching crystals, but had carved out an inverted
cone in the packs around him, whose curling
edges hung over like cornices about the strangely
excavated bowl. It was at this point that Leacraft’s
ears caught a distant sound of mingled cries—a
piteous union of a woman’s voice, quickly succeeded
by the more robust shout of a man. The sounds
seemed to rise and fall. They were at times almost
lost in the rising roar of the wind, or reduced to
ghost-like semblances of sound, and again they
came with the clearest impact on his ears, the shrill
scream, the longer resonant “Hallo,” or “Help.”
It was impossible for him to determine whether the
cries were answering each other, or whether they
indicated a mutual and consentaneous peril.</p>

<p>He was not alone in their detection. A number
of figures—those of the men engaged in keeping
the paths open—all sheeted like ghosts with a pellicle
of icy snow, had slowly gathered about him,
drawn together by this weird summons. A distinct
horror possessed them. There was somewhere
in the immobile and voiceless streets before
them at least two perishing lives. Could they be
found? Could they be extricated from their rising
tomb of snow? At times the voices grew fainter,
as if their subjects were surrendering their
vitality to cold and exhaustion, and then again they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
sounded in the approaching darkness—there were
now no lights at night in the doomed city—more
appealingly clear as if by a despairing struggle of
strength they hoped to prolong their fruitless invocation.
No one spoke. Leacraft broke the silence.</p>

<p>“We must save them,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s nae canny wark to do,” muttered one of the
shapes nearest to him.</p>

<p>“But it’s a grewsome matter to let them dee that
wa,” urged a second.</p>

<p>“Weel, weel, they’re nae the farst. The country
side is as fu’ o corpses as a crow’s gizzard o’
oats,” admonished a third.</p>

<p>Leacraft had been listening. He felt sure that
the sounds proceeded from somewhere on George
street, a little to the eastward of its intersection
with Hanover. He suspected that the fugitives had
taken refuge in St. Andrew’s Church. He turned
to look at the muffled forms about him. “If two
of you will help me, with snow-shoes we can reach
them.”</p>

<p>There was at first no response, only a protesting
shrug, and a disposition to avoid any direct refusal
by moving away. Leacraft spoke again.
“The snow packs easily; we can get there on
snow-shoes in a short time. There can be no danger.
These unfortunate people are imprisoned in
the church, I think; there’s a woman there; the
man needs help to get her out; he probably could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
break his way over here, but he can’t drag her with
him, and he won’t leave her. It’s murder to turn
our backs on them.”</p>

<p>Leacraft was alone, save for the presence of the
second speaker. The rest had disappeared, and
the thud of their mallets and the rattle of the
sledges acquainted him with their distant operations.</p>

<p>“Meester, I’ll gie ye a haud. There’s snaw-shoes
down the track in a tram; I’ll hae them here
in a jiffy.” He vanished down the long cut.</p>

<p>Leacraft called after him: “Bring two bottles
of whiskey. You can use my name for them at the
hotel.”</p>

<p>While he waited for the man’s return, Leacraft
outlined a possible avenue of approach to the imprisoned
couple, if couple it was. He could indistinctly
see—the day was waning—that on the west
side of Hanover street, by reason of the north-westerly
direction of the storm, the housetops had
formed a partial protection to the street below, and
that the heavy ridged hill of snow occupied the centre
of the street, lurching over against the west.
Up the short slope this partial shelter continued,
but in George street, beyond, the storm drove scurrying
blasts of wind that whirled the snow upward
in fantastic pirouetting volleys, and, doubtless,
with wicked intent, had piled the drifts up in insurmountable
entrenchments against the doors of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
buildings on that street. The prospect of progress
there was discouraging. Still there would be
ways; the renewed calls nerved him to desperation.</p>

<p>The volunteer returned with the snow-shoes, a
pair for both of them, and an extra pair for the
imprisoned man, and the bulging bulk of three bottles
of whiskey. He explained the latter excess:
“They gied me the thraw, and I had no heart to
haud the ither back. Let well eneugh alone, I
say.”</p>

<p>“Now, my brave friend, we must know each
other’s name, though we shall not be separated, as
we must be tied together. But men working in
peril become close companions,” said Leacraft to
the man.</p>

<p>“Weel, sir, it mak’s sma’ difference what name
we go by, but, an’ you like it, just ca’ me Jim.”</p>

<p>Leacraft opened one of the bottles of whiskey,
and handed it to his companion, who eagerly accepted
the invitation, and took so hearty a draught
that Leacraft felt some misgivings over his usefulness.
The man explained: “Ut’s no dram habit
I have, sir, but the cauld ha’ gone to mee bains,
an’ the wee drap pits fire in my sperit. It’s bonny
stuff. It’s nae mickle harm to keep the fires burning
in a blast like this. Tak’ my advice and do the
same yoursel’, sir.”</p>

<p>Leacraft was indeed not unwilling to follow this
example, and thus reinforced, the two men plunged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
into the snow banks that with irregular surfaces of
hills and valleys spread before them. They floundered
desperately forward, finding that the snow-shoes
were indispensable, and the precaution of being
tied together most helpful. The calling voices,
with intermittent pauses, were still heard, and
both Leacraft and his companion exerted themselves
to return the calls with reassurance. It was
evident that they had, at least at times, been heard,
for the distant shouts became timed to their own,
and this indication of recognition served to
strengthen and increase their efforts. The work
was difficult, and with recurrent accesses of the
storm’s fury, the snowy wreaths, detached from
the cornices of the houses, or whirled from off the
edges of the tumultuous drifts, blinded and overwhelmed
them. Fortunately, the wind came in
gusts, and it was this circumstance that permitted
Leacraft first to hear the voices. Between the wintry
assaults of the wind, in the pauses of its fury,
they stumbled on, forcing their way under the
shelter of the western houses, and, at the corner of
George street, struck boldly out towards the monument,
where Leacraft had discerned the inverted
cone of snow. The cause of this formation was
now apparent, and rendered their further progress
more precarious. The wind surged down George
street, and by a slight deflection in its course from
the axis of the street itself, was thrown into a vertical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
motion at the corners of Hanover street, and
became a cyclone, whose towering and fiercely
moving walls were materialized to the eye in the
successive shells of snow raised in oscillating spires
above the tops of the houses, where it again was
seized by the direct wind and sent in dusky masses
skywards. The picture of George street at this
point was appalling enough. The snow lay deeply
piled in the street, forming a high central ridge,
and crossing this obliquely were traverse drifts
which had a slow motion down the street towards
the Melvill memorial; these even at times coalesced,
assuming the aspect of a big comber at sea,
and advancing with similar menace. When these
snow billows flowed into the depression about the
statue, they filled it, and then the revolving winds,
like a gigantic and invisible augur, excavated it
again, tossing the snow out in spurts resembling
the geyser-like bursts in front of a snow-plough.
At such moments it would have been almost impossible
to have crossed the spot, with the buffeting
wind shaking with flagitious fury the folds of snow
about the traveller and entombing him also in their
rising sheets.</p>

<p>Leacraft and Jim had just reached the eastern
edge of the hollow described above, when one of
the travelling billows of snow poured into the pit
on its western margin, and the impetuous blasts began
to dislodge the inrushing tide with incredible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
velocity. The shocks of snow overwhelmed the rescuers,
and for a moment it seemed as if the contest
between them and the fury of nature was too unequal
a struggle. The support of the snow-shoes
held them fairly well above the snow, but this onslaught
knocked them down, and once down, the industrious
drifts hastily began their entombment.
To speak was impossible, and all Leacraft could do
was to jerk the rope which connected them, as a
summons for Jim to reach him. His purpose was
obvious. Together, one or the other might make
such a purchase of his companion as to extricate
himself, and then assist his friend to rise. Jim
understood the suggestion of the pull, and groped
his way forward, and touched Leacraft, whom he
found prostrate. His body offered a flooring for
him to rise upon, and in this way he regained the
surface, his head emerging into the blustering air.
He quickly established himself and hauled Leacraft
upward, who expected the movement, and had
drawn his knees upward to help him regain his
feet. The two men were now again upright and in
action, but terribly exhausted and half immersed
in the snow. The wave had passed and reformed
partially after its disruption, while its north and
south wings, which had escaped the passage of the
pit, like white breakers, moved on before it.</p>

<p>A simultaneous motion with both, which had
something almost comic in it, and would not have,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
under different circumstances, escaped receiving
its tribute of merriment, brought from the pockets
of each the whisky bottles, that quickly contributed
some of their contents to the renewal of their ebbing
strength. As they carefully replaced the helpful
vials, they heard again, but now more clearly,
the renewed shouts of the imprisoned captives, and
Jim, putting his hands to his mouth, screamed with
all the force he could put into the effort,
“Coming.” It carried, and something articulate
returned, which to Leacraft sounded like “Come
quick!”</p>

<p>Their strength renewed, the two men began
again their brave combat with the elements, and
forced their way across the snow fields towards the
houses on the north side of George street, which
furnished a slight shield against the ferocity of the
storm. A helpful lull in the blast enabled them to
make their way more quickly. The walls of St. Andrew’s
Church were near at hand, and all doubts
as to the position of the voices were removed. The
calls came very clearly to their ears. Creeping
along the edges of the houses, they succeeded in
reaching the church, and found that, on the back
of the drifts, they were then at the level of its upper
windows. The men peered into the darkness beyond
the panes of glass and knocked vociferously.
Voices and steps answered them. The next moment
a man’s figure could be discerned advancing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
and then the window opened. Leacraft entered
first, followed by Jim, and both turned to the yet
silent figure beside them. His silence lasted scarcely
an instant. “God!” he exclaimed. “You have
come none too soon! We should have died here!
There is a young girl downstairs, a friend of mine.
We started for the train, and just in front of the
church she fainted. I drew her in here, as the
door was open. A chill followed; I could not carry
her away in this storm, and we were caught. It
was our last chance. I can’t explain now the reason
for our remaining so long behind the rest of
the people who have left Edinburgh. We are here.
Can you get us out? I can shift for myself, but
Ethel—you see it is impossible. <span class="locked">What—what—”</span></p>

<p>Leacraft interrupted. “Explanations are not
needed. We must all get out of this at once. We
must take her between us, and fight our way back.”</p>

<p>Already he had begun to move towards the flight
of stairs near to them, to descend to the man’s companion,
when the man seized him by the arm,
passed him, calling to them to follow. They descended
rapidly, and saw on the ground floor of the
church, lying in a pew, with a flickering gas jet
burning feebly above it, the figure of the woman the
man had mentioned. She had propped herself on
her hand and elbow, and gazed at the three faces
looking down on her, with a frightened, still expression,
in which relief and confidence, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
were not altogether absent. Jim had already
brought out the whisky bottle, and, with unpractised
directness, offered it to the girl. “Here, my
leddy; tak’ a sip of this, and let it be a good one.
An’, gentlemen,” turning to Leacraft and the
stranger, “it’s awa’ with a’ o’ us, or the deil will
mak’ our shrouds.”</p>

<p>Leacraft turned to the man. “Have you snow-shoes?”
he asked. “Yes,” answered the stranger.
“Then,” continued Leacraft, “we will start. Out
of the window upstairs. Jim, you go ahead, and
I and the gentleman will carry the lady. Madame,”
to the lady, “this is a forlorn trip, but it will soon
be over, and I feel we can trust you to help us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” came the rapid reply. The girl started
to rise, and her companion helped her quickly
to her feet. The party was ready, and without
further words the four ascended the steps, made
their way to the window, and after one glance
at the raging weather outside, another reassurance
for all from the indispensable bottles, the plunge
was made.</p>

<p>The two fugitives, if such was a proper designation
for them, were well clothed, and the risk of exposure
was avoided. It now was a question of
physical endurance only, and partly, too, of some
possible leniency in the weather. Already their
previous steps were thickly buried in the flowing
tides of snow, and Leacraft and Jim noted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
apprehension that the wind seemed fiercer, and the
way back towards Hanover street blacker and more
obscure, with volleys of snow dust thrown upward
in increasing clouds. For a moment the party
hesitated, and Leacraft and Jim both seemed
over-awed and perplexed. Almost at the same moment
they cast their eyes towards the corner of
George and St. David streets, and saw to their wonder
and delight that the front of the Commercial
Bank building was relatively clear of snow, and
the intimation furnished by its appearance was that
the way was more open on St. David street and that
in that direction egress and safety lay.</p>

<p>“This way,” was the laconic order from Leacraft,
and they turned eastward. Leacraft and
the stranger, who had given his name as Thomsen,
supported the woman between them, and she was
directed to throw her arms around their necks, and
the sense of support to this frail girl, whose face,
terrified and pale from weakness, yet had revealed
to Leacraft a winning prettiness, made both men
alert and strenuous. An obstacle of some seriousness
stood before them; two heaped up mounds
occupied the centre of the street. It was between
these mimic hills that they made the fortunate discovery
of the comparative freedom of the opposite
corner, as it was in a measure the interposition of
these very barriers that kept it so. But the passage—the
cleft—between these mounds, that somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
seemed rigid points, underwent startling alterations.
It was filled up with avalanches of snow,
which at almost regular intervals were driven out
by the massive wind pressure, and the dislodged
bodies of snow were seen to spread out toward the
south on the opposite side of the mounds from the
observers’ position, in geyser-like spouts. It was
necessary to thread this pass, but it would be inevitable
danger if they were caught in one of the
recurrent avalanches. Sinister as the chance
seemed, it must be taken. And towards this triangular
cut they slowly moved. Jim was in front
of the little group, which, sheeted with snow, with
bent heads and in silence, resembled Arctic explorers,
as they are pictured bringing in some
dying or exhausted companion.</p>

<p>The wind was somewhat behind them, though in
the collision of the reflected waves from the houses
on the south side, the vexed air shot about them in
a hundred contradictory directions, and held them
in a tempest of draughts. And now they were at
the northern slope of the mounds; the cut was open;
it had been cleared a minute before. Through it
they saw more plainly that the bank steps and the
corner of St. David street presented more favorable
conditions; a dash and they would effect their escape.
Leacraft had not failed to notice that the
intervals between the inexplicable down-rushes of
snow into the gap, were about three minutes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
that something more than that time elapsed before
their expulsion. He whispered to Thomsen, whose
fatigue was becoming too evident, “Keep up, sir.
Once through this hole, and we are safe.”</p>

<p>During all this time since their entrance through
the window of the church, Leacraft and Jim had
remained tied together, and the strong, steady haul
of the workman upon the rope now greatly assisted
Leacraft, who was quite sensible that he must
largely depend on his strength at this critical moment
for their preservation. It was certainly no
exaggeration to say that as they entered that rather
inconspicuous gateway, between two snow drifts
in George street, Edinburgh, in November 1909,
they stood on that metropolitan thoroughfare, in
the Jaws of Death. The simile may sound and look
shockingly untrue. It is the exact truth. The
white inclines rose on each side of them, and the
width of the wintry embrasure was about twenty
feet; in less than a minute even with their lagging
steps they would have crossed it. Suddenly Leacraft
felt himself pulled sideways; only the rope stretched
tightly between himself and Jim saved him from
falling, if falling it could be called, where they were
so immersed in snow. Thomsen had dropped in his
tracks and with a low cry of fear the woman’s arm
slipped from his neck and she clung convulsively to
Leacraft. It was critical. In a little more than two
minutes they would probably be buried—which at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
this stage of exhaustion meant death. Leacraft
tugged savagely at the rope, and the surprised Jim,
almost thrown on his back, returned. A glance told
him everything. Leacraft, without speaking, nodded
to the motionless figure, beginning by reason of
the icy chill smiting his face from the snow, to stir,
and seizing the girl, passed on. Jim managed to
jerk Thomsen to his feet, and half holding, half
pushing him, hastened, lest Leacraft should feel his
weight on the rope, and be hampered in his own
struggles. It was slow work, the snow-shoes, so
essential for their safety, could only be painfully
shoved forwards beneath the snow. It was like
wading in deep water but it was a likeness enormously
enlarged in difficulty and strain.</p>

<p>They had not pushed through the miniature defile
when symptomatic showers of snow drifted in upon
them in blinding columns. The avalanche was coming.
The terror stricken Alpine climber, who, behind
some serac on the lofty glacier, has his ears
assaulted with the roar of the descending avalanche,
in no literal sense has greater reason for
fear than did those men in the streets of Edinburgh
at that moment.</p>

<p>Leacraft shouted, “On! On! On! One second and
we are lost!” This despairing cry was not ill calculated
to spur their efforts. The very agony of fright
it summoned in the two men behind him gave them
the strength of desperation. For one instant the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
spent muscles became steel. They floundered forward,
and fell together almost in one heap beyond
the portal of the two mounds as the swirling snow
in torrents obliterated their outlines in new envelopes.
Their fall toppled Leacraft over on his side.
The confused objects, looking like some assortment
of discarded bundles lay quiet, the darting cold had
brought with it the treacherous drowsiness into
their eyes, and had already begun to lock the keyholes
of their senses. It was Jim who had roused
himself to action. He struck Leacraft across the
face with his gloved hand, and did the same to
Thomsen, whom he again lifted to his feet. The
smart of the stinging blow startled Leacraft on his
legs; his nose bled, and he could feel the woman
still stiffly clinging to him. It was Jim who now
uttered the warning, “Get out o’ this. I hae the
lugger all right. Get down to the bank.” Leacraft
looked quickly. The bank steps were beneath
them, and the vagaries of the storm alternately
covered and cleared them of snow. Half
rolling, he pitched down the slope, following Jim,
who had his arm around Thomsen’s waist, and
who, supporting himself on Jim’s shoulder, was
manfully helping his rescuer.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, with staggering steps and frequent
falls, the four gained the protection of the
bank. This refuge acted favorably. Their spirits
revived, and the whisky flasks assisted. Their attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
toward the storm became a little defiant.
“We can do it now. It’s only a step around to
Princes street. Ethel, how do you feel?” It was
the young Scotchman who spoke, and the young
woman even smiled as she answered “O! Ned, we
shall be saved! How can we thank this gentleman?”
“Excuse me” blurted out Leacraft, “we
won’t waste time just now in an exchange of civilities.
The opportunity for that formality will come
when we are all out of this.”</p>

<p>He stepped almost impatiently to the edge of the
building and found that a narrow crevice intervened
between the drifts and the walls of the
houses, and a further inspection revealed the utterly
unexpected good luck, that this peculiar chimney
way extended along the west side of St. David
street to Princes street. Their safety seemed secured.
In a few minutes after this welcome discovery,
with careful steps, Leacraft insisting upon
the Scotchman and himself lifting the young woman
together, with Jim leading, the party slowly
crept out and along the buildings on St. David
street, and in a short time had reached Princes
street, where more arms, vigorous legs, and robust
bodies helped them through the shooting drifts into
the open rift, that the men and sledges were still
precariously maintaining.</p>

<p>Leacraft hurried Thomsen and his charge to the
hotel; he turned to Jim, and grasped his hand fervently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
“You’ve been a true man, Jim. I shan’t
forget this. Every one leaves Edinburgh to-night
by the train. I want you in my compartment.
This young woman and her friends will be with
me. I’ll find you at the hotel before the train
leaves. Watch for me.” As he spoke, and before
the expostulation on Jim’s lips was uttered, a long
hoarse whistle like a wail came to their ears. It
was the warning of the trainmen fearful to delay
longer their departure from the doomed city—and
with it, hurrying steps, shouts and injunctions
along the cut, indicated its recognition.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” cried Leacraft, and together
the men ran forwards, towards the Lothian road,
finding themselves as they advanced in a jostling
crowd, animated by but one hope, escape from the
buried capital.</p>

<p>The condition indicated in the foregoing narrative,
may now be more explicitly reviewed. The
dislocations and subsidences in the Caribbean and
Central American areas had developed along constructional
lines, and had swept away the lesser
Antilles and the Isthmus.</p>

<p>These formerly elevated points were simply projections
upon two orogenic blocks of the earth’s
crust, one extending from South America to Porto
Rico, the other the narrower coastal shelf forming
the isthmus. More plainly, these remarkable
strips, curved in outline, and with a varying length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
of four hundred to five hundred miles, maintained
a precarious stability with references to the adjoining
edges against which they abutted, and when
a shock, violent enough to rupture or release those
edges, supervened they fell <em>out</em> and <em>down</em> like a
brick or stone from an arch. When the more eastern
of these blocks, that on which the lesser Antilles
stood, dropped, the oceanic heated currents of
the equatorial belt of the Atlantic rushed into the
Caribbean basin as usual, but with a perceptible acceleration.
The currents did not meet the frictional
resistance of an archipelago of small islands. Their
progress westward continued, through the almost
simultaneously created outlet into the Pacific, by
the submergence of the isthmus. Upon the first
report of President Roosevelt’s apprehensions that
this catastrophe would involve a disastrous diversion
of the Gulf Stream, European geographers
had contemptuously treated it as impossible, and
stigmatized it as “an amusing futility of envy.”
They dwelt upon this fact, that the Gulf Stream
did not invade the bent arm of water forming the
eastern water boundary of the Isthmus of Panama,
but shot across this somewhat withdrawn angle,
passing with undiminished volume in a straight
path beyond Honduras, into the capacious pocket of
the Gulf of Mexico. “Let it be conceded,” began
an authoritative refutation in the <i>London Times</i>,
“that the structural impediment to the mixture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific existing in
the Isthmus of Panama is removed. Does mixture
follow? By no means, that is in no way subversive
of present hydrographic conditions. There
will be a marginal intermixture, of course, where
there is actual contact, but it is presumptuous and
opposed to experience to say that two enormous
bodies of water will promiscuously exchange their
contents through an opening, relatively to their volume
and extent, what a pinhole would be to the
juxtaposed masses of two great reservoirs. Further,
this <em>disinclination</em>, as a physical impossibility,
of the waters of the two contiguous bodies of practically
equal density to diffuse into each other, is
increased by the strength and velocity of the Gulf
Stream itself, which rushes past the isthmus deflection,
and instead of being turned aside into that
narrow aperture, would exert a suctorial influence
upon the tides of the Pacific, actually (though this
is in no way insisted upon) reinforcing its own volume
and momentum by their contributions.</p>

<p>“There can be no valid reasons for anxiety in
regard to the future of the kingdom so far—and
that is very far indeed—as its prosperity and happiness
depend upon a continuance of the supply
of warm waters from the west.”</p>

<p>The writer of this article in the <i>London Times</i>
had not realized, or had not heard of, the elevation
of Cuba and the emergence of the broken range<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
of keys between Cape Gracias de Dios and Jamaica,
nor had he considered the “suctorial influence” of
the Mexican current in the Pacific, southward on
the west coast of Mexico and Central America upon
the Atlantic areas, nor had he suspected the quantitative
effect of a higher barometric pressure in the
Atlantic over the pressure resident above the surface
of the Pacific, a difference practically amounting
to a push upon the surface distensions of the
Atlantic in the direction of the Pacific, the very
moment a <em>sensible</em> union between them took place.
And it was a <em>sensible</em> union. His comparison of
it to a pinhole was utterly misleading. Above a certain
minimum, no matter what the size of the major
bodies of water were, relatively, connection between
them meant, under the circumstances, mixture, and
a hole four hundred miles wide was much above
that minimum. At the very moment when he
penned this astute demonstration, the Gulf Stream
had begun to throw its seething waters across the
sunken isthmus. And the effects followed with
startling rapidity. The author of the consoling reflections
quoted, perhaps had hardly had time to
have forgotten the obsequious reception his words
received, when his admiring listeners were brought
face to face with the worst consequences he had considered
absurdly impossible.</p>

<p>The summer in Great Britain had been noticeably
colder, and with the passage of the autumnal equinox,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the winds increased in strength, and brought
with them a terrifying cold. All records were broken,
and the sinking thermometers withdrawing
their silver threads into the diminutive bulbs, became
suddenly the chief subjects of conversation.
The corridor of the Houses of Parliament, the
state room of Windsor, the clubs of Pall Mall and
the parlors of the West End, no less than the alcoves
of London Bridge, the shops in White Friars,
or the auction stalls of the Ghetto, buzzed with the
endless comparison of observations made on these
hitherto unnoticed instruments of precision, and
their slightest variations took precedence in the
daily prints, over the aphorisms of the prime minister
or the nullities of the king. An enormously increased
sale of thermometers accompanied the sinister
records of the deepening cold; importations
of them from the United States spread an unprecedented
wonder throughout the world as to the meaning
of this change in climate, and the range of temperature,
as the season advanced, was as much an object
of solicitude as the growing expenditures of
London, and more talked about than the fancied
rupture between Spain and France. Meteorological
journals were besieged with subscribers; Abbe,
Loomis, Ferrel were as much in demand at the book
stores as Glaisher or Thomson; Flammarion was
as popular as Tyndal, and the lectures delivered at
the British Museum had such suffocating success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
that the Red Cross Societies of London conceived
the idea of public instructions for a tuppenny, to
replenish their forgotten treasuries. The pedestrian
and the chance acquaintance of the tramway would
interview each other on the prevalent topic of
alarm, and quote Wells, and Boussingault, and
Daniel, and Quetelet, Forbes, Helmersen, Kamtz
and Kupffer with more unction and accuracy than
he did the current prices of wool or barley.</p>

<p>The fright began in the north, in Scotland. News
first arrived from the Hebrides, of desolating cold
and overwhelming snow storms; then the story
was picked up by the Shetlands and Aberdeen, and
then the really tragic fate of Iceland was recounted.
The cable between Scotland and Iceland, completed
in 1906, brought the tale. And a freezing
tale it was. Iceland had become a snow heap; its
interior valleys were filled up, from Heckla to
Skaldbreid; from Skaldbreid to Esja one portentous
blanket of snow had levelled all inequalities
of the surface. The terror stricken inhabitants
deserted their farms and fought their way to Reykjavik,
leaving all they possessed of sheep, cattle
and horses to be destroyed by the pitiless tooth of
the Ice King. Reykjavik had been deserted; its
people fleeing to ships and steamers as the remorseless
winds piled up the white shrouds of its Arctic
burial. The cable summoned assistance for those
yet fighting for life on the water’s edge, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the sea air helped them to maintain a margin of
cleared ground. Over ten feet had accumulated,
and ceaseless blizzards, unchecked, and even increasing
in fury, with a tireless and killing cold,
had renewed the ice age within that boreal republic.
The panic spread. From confidence and scorn the
people of Scotland and England and Ireland plunged
into the clamor of despair and maniacal forebodings.
Religious fraternities of “Frigidists” were
organized, whose exegesis made the prophecy of the
End of the World a menace of destruction by ice.
Geikie’s <i>Ice Age</i>, and Croll’s <i>Climate and Time</i>
were read by earl and bellboy, and in the midst of
the general consternation, the publishers of these
books, in cheap form, doubled their business capacity
and their fortunes.</p>

<p>Then came the sudden visitation of Edinburgh,
with the scenes just recounted. The transference
of these immense swarms of people, the evicted tenants
of the north (poor creatures who had never
owned the land they lived on except by the sufferance
of some landlord duke or “gentleman,”)
southward, was a task of difficulty. Sir John C—,
was provost marshal of the city at the time (his
father before him had held the same office), and
had devised a scheme of goodly proportions and
efficacy. He appointed wardens, who, with assistants
selected by themselves, visited the families
in the several bailiwicks in Edinburgh, and prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
them for the departure, and who also apportioned
to the different wards of the town the
streaming populations from all the neighboring
villages, towns and the country sides. The railroads
were seized by the government, and systematic
transportation, begun and carried on night and
day. They were taken to the larger seaports of
England, and of course to London. Already secret
misgivings that chilled the marrow of their bones,
and made the blood circling in their hearts freeze
with horror, were entertained by public men, that
perchance this was not all, nor indeed the worst.
Was the power of the Kingdom of Great Britain to
be made the jest of the snowflake and the ice-cicle?
The thought made reason totter, but new gleams
of anticipation seemed suddenly to place upon that
very thought the consecration of joy. They should
be driven from their hearthstone to bring the English
culture in other English lands, and emancipated
men—men of the new type, like H. G. Wells—said
that that culture, torn from the swaddling
bands of a conventional tradition, the silly materialism
of forms and dresses, of titles and classes, of
imperialistic gew-gaws, and the impediments of
habit, would expand into a modern civilization,
which, carrying forward all the strains of
strength, and imaginative and ideal aims, it had
before, might incorporate in them the new procreative
life of a liberal social state. Well! there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
was some consolation in that, but a consolation
robbed of much positive consistency when all
around them they saw the loss of trade, the paralysis
of hope, the desertion of homes, and the rising
threats of that inexorable and deaf deity—Nature.</p>

<p>Leacraft had watched and waited. Every new
development, each changing report, the wearily
studied logs of the ships and steamers, the daily
averages of temperature and rainfall, the swelling
disorder in the climate of the United States, and
confirmed rumors of the hot current—which might
be the Gulf Stream—pouring, pouring northward,
and hugging the shores of California and Washington
and Oregon, and even repelling the cold from
Alaska, supplying a stove to its shores, which, it
was promptly surmised, would make of it a northern
paradise, all, in a cumulative way, pointed to
one result—the evacuation of England. His speculative
mind hurried on to the picturing of the changed
aspects of the national life, and he felt that for
once Science, embodied in the laws of Nature, was
about to put to flight the mentality of men, and
pour the vials of its confusion over the proud, the
boasting defiance of their thin optimism. And yet—what
might not Opportunity perform? Perhaps
the old receptacles of civilization needed emptying;
their garnered seeds to be more quickly cast upon
the winds of chance to germinate and flower again
in the waste places of the world. And Leacraft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
hurried to and fro—a small inherited competency
had dissolved his business bonds—a lonely, sad
man, excited by the thoughts of the world’s trembling
position on a new threshold of events, and
thus forgetting the gnawing pains of his own disappointment.</p>

<p>During September he had been at the far north
of Scotland, and retreated day by day with the
invading cold, fleeing with its fleeing people, southward.
On the memorable evening whose events
have been rehearsed, he had found Edinburgh practically
voided, and left to its entombment. The work
of getting the people away, of convincing the incredulous,
of providing for the needy, of deporting
the treasures of this great depository, had been hastily
and imperfectly done. In spite of Sir John
C—’s useful plans, it could not be different. Disorder,
recriminations, riot and clashes were inevitable
at a moment of such sudden penetrating terror.
Blocks after blocks of private homes remained
with little or nothing of their rich contents removed.
This condition was understood, and predatory
bands of desperate men broke into them, encamped
in them and defied expulsion. They
laughed at warnings, and after filling their improvised
camps with coal and stores, prepared with exultation
to enjoy this novel debauch. Furniture
and household effects had been dumped or deserted
in the streets, and almost any extemporaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
digging in the drifts would uncover books,
clothing and utensils. A grotesque hogarthian aspect
had been produced by the retreat of the cats
to the houses, and their mingled swarms at windows
and on sills, whither they were strangely followed
by hordes of mice and rats, expelled from the
country and filtering into the city in scampering
lines before the weather had reached the height of
its tempestuous inclemency.</p>

<p>The documentary archives of the city had been
locked up in great safes and left for more propitious
days—in summer? This example had been
imitated in thousands of the better class houses, as
the professional, the <em>official</em> opinion, still hesitated
to contemplate the monstrous alternative of a permanent
sepulture of their beautiful home.</p>

<p>One thing had been accomplished, and it was
well done. The people, those who would leave, had
been gotten away. When on the tenth of September
the first storm of snow began, and the mercury
sunk to a few degrees below zero Fah., the suffering
became intense. Soon the railroads were blocked.
Enlightened opinion had received its instructions.
The return of Scotland to the bondage of snow
and ice was published, and the publications carried
conviction to a great many. The loss of the
Gulf Stream was at length acknowledged. The
impetus of the discovery made the worst prophecies
credible. The intensity of this acquiescence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
was astounding. It became a matter of faith that
the population should vacate their own city, and
they obeyed instructions unanimously with a touching
self-surrender to fate. Great numbers left
Leith by boats and steamers summoned from London.
The railroads responded with promptitude,
though, by reason of a sudden access of energy in
the government, nothing less would have been tolerated,
longer than was necessary to confiscate their
property and franchises. The phenomenal desertion
of the city by three hundred thousand souls
seemed as fore-ordained, as obligatory in the regime
of events, as the setting of the sun, or the return
of the seasons.</p>

<p>But no activity of all the available means of
transportation would have sufficed to take a population
of more than three hundred thousand men and
women in less than two months away from the city,
unless it had been supplemented by other means.
And a strange and most effective movement accomplished
completely what more recondite or
artificial methods would have failed to secure. The
“Frigidists,” the group of fanatical preachers and
their followers, who found in the present calamity
an opportunity for a religious propaganda, or,
through the fermentation and clouded expectations
of their own zeal, believed it to be the expression
of a supernatural agency, had begun a street crusade
(always in Edinburgh popular and familiar)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
to accomplish the removal of the people. These
singular fanatics served a most benevolent end, and
their strange hallucinations wisely aided the anxious
efforts of the authorities. They arrayed themselves
in white, and went bareheaded through the
streets of the city, exhorting all who would listen to
accept their interpretations of the approaching
judgment. They wove their texts of prophecy with
denunciations of sin, and with the crowding evidences
of some astounding climatic change, repeated
with accelerated eagerness in paper, pulpit
and forum, they acquired a tyrannous control over
the emotions of the populace.</p>

<p>Then they quickly, and with excellent discernment,
organized the people into small regiments,
distributed to them white cockades and white rosettes
and marched them out of the city, southward,
over the frozen and snow-lined roads. This
evacuation began scarcely soon enough for the
best results. But it gave relief. These moving
companies, accompanied with vans and horse carts,
and vehicles of every description, gathering numbers
along their way, grew in picturesque confusion,
as flocks of sheep and herds of cattle were
united to them, or the miners from the coal pits,
and the artisans from the factories joined in the
vast, singing army.</p>

<p>Like the inexorable morality of the French mobs
in the French Revolution, who scornfully resisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the temptations of their own hunger in a fierce
zeal to protect private property, so an overmastering
enthusiasm permeated those rough Scottish
nomads, and they marched through the country
rigorously just and honest. There was suffering
and death among them, and nothing could have been
more sublimely pathetic than the improvised services
of burial that were held from time to time
along the roads they crossed. Those who heard its
vibrant and powerful melody will remember the
eclipsing magnificence of the hymn, sung to the air
of <i>Adestes Fideles</i>, which began with the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Firm, faithful and tried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With endless glory crowned.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The success of these “Frigidists” was phenomenal,
but it also clearly arose from the awful portents
of change which made the stoutest men
quail, and not inaptly tested the scepticism of the
boldest scoffers. The revolution in Nature had
not only affected Scotland; its dire effects were
felt in the whole of the Scandinavian area, and the
more southern parts of Europe, which had owed
some measure of their favorable winters to the direct
or intermediate influence of the Gulf Stream,
were now made to feel their sudden penury in its
removal.</p>

<p>A frightful stagnation invaded the European
markets; a panic of doubt spread confusion everywhere,
and those who controlled the sources of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
money, very soon checked its use in the avenues of
trade, while of necessity speculation and the desire
for speculation simultaneously vanished.</p>

<p>It was the last train intending to leave Edinburgh
that, on November 28th, waited for the Provost
Marshal, and the little army of workers, and
which Leacraft also expected to take. The tracks
southward had been patrolled by trains of cars or
locomotives for every five miles, and these had
kept the way cleared, while they reinforced each
other at critical junctures. When this last connection
between the muffled city and the south should
be broken, then practically Scotland returned, over
the sweep of sixty thousand years, to a geological
phase <em>resembling</em> that which Geikie, Scotland’s
own great historian of nature, had described in
these words: “All northern Europe and northern
America disappeared beneath a thick crust of ice
and snow, and the glaciers of such regions as Switzerland
assumed gigantic proportions. This great
sheet of land-ice levelled up the valleys of Britain,
and stretched across our mountains and hills, down
to the low latitudes of England, being only one connected
or confluent series of mighty glaciers, the
ice crept ever downwards, and onwards from the
mountains, following the direction of the principal
valleys, and pushing far out to sea, where it
terminated at last in deep water, many miles away
from what now forms the coast-line of our country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
This sea of ice was of such extent that the glaciers
of Scandinavia coalesced with those of Scotland,
upon what is now the floor of the shallow North
Sea, while a mighty stream of ice flowing outwards
from the western seaboard obliterated the Hebrides,
and sent its icebergs adrift in the deep waters of
the Atlantic.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TERROR OF IT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Leacraft and Jim reached the hotel at the Caledonian
station, in a crowd of breathless men, all
anxious to escape to more reassuring neighborhoods.
Thomsen and the young lady so opportunely
rescued had availed themselves of the restorative
resources of the hotel, and had largely recovered
from the exposure and scare of their experience.
Leacraft met Sir John C— standing
at the entrance of the hotel, his face clouded with
grief and anxiety. Strained to the last limit of endurance
by his unwearied exertion to secure the
safety of the people, and almost prostrated by the
desolating sorrow of deserting the great city, the
distinguished publisher expressed in his looks his
intense misery of mind. Leacraft expressed a few
words of condolence, which were hardly noticed,
and then hurried to the former writing room of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
hotel, where he found a fire burning, and a hastily
prepared luncheon, around which a dense crowd of
men were collected, filling the room almost to suffocation,
greedily devouring the welcome repast,
and muttering doubts of their eventually escaping
at all if they remained any longer.</p>

<p>“Sir John hates to get away,” commented one.
“He just can’t make up his mind to go. His heart
is broke. But what’s the use? We can’t stay here
and be buried alive. The trainmen say it’s a hard
job now to get through, and all the way to Glenarken
is full of big drifts. I say we must shake
this, and it’s nobody’s right to run our heads into
danger for the whim of a little love for the old
town. Sure, we are all hard enough up, and it’s we
that has not got a roof to our heads, nor a bite to
our stomachs that has the worst to fear. It’s a
cruel sufferin’ to think of it at all; but so it is,
and it’s no use fashing.”</p>

<p>“Weel, weel,” said another, “it’s an awfu’
plight, and naebody can say what’s next. We
maun better be dead than to pit our heads in a
pother of snaw and wait for next simmer to melt
us out.”</p>

<p>“Simmer, man, is it!” exclaimed a rough cart-man
with a huge ham sandwich in each hand, and
his jaws working on the remnants of their predecessor.
“Simmer! It’s all up with the simmers
frae now to the end o’ the warld. It’s bonny Scotland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
good-bye, and mind you, man, you’ll never see
gorze again on the Queen’s Drive, I’m thinking, and
you’ll never tak’ your bonnet aff on Arthur’s seat,
nor pluck the daisy on Holy Rood mead. You’ll
never canter to the Pentlands, nor hear the sang
of praise go up frae the Roslin chapel, and you’ll
nae hear the bell toll frae Grey Friars kirk, nor
mark time wi’ the Hielanders in St. Giles’, and
you’ll never bide the chance when you can see
old Hay’s shop in High street, nor watch the
middlings stare their een out at John Knox’s
hame. It’s ower by naw,” and the good fellow
turned away in a choking effort to repress his own
tears, and swallow the generous morsels he had
bitten from his overloaded hands.</p>

<p>Leacraft pressed by these disturbed groups, and
found, after he had inducted Jim to the hospitalities
of the various tables, his own strength and
composure deserting him. He sank into a chair
and covered his face with his hands. It seemed as
if he had lived through some dreadful nightmare,
and the weird and sickening sense of yet more miseries,
rising thick and fast, covering with gloom a
nation’s happiness, stunned him.</p>

<p>A soft voice awoke him. He looked up hastily
and saw the lady whose arms, half an hour before,
had clung unresistingly around his neck. She was
unquestionably very pretty, and the returning
flush upon her cheeks gave the alabaster clearness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
of her brow a singular effrontery of beauty. Elsewhere,
or under different circumstances, it would
have produced in Leacraft a momentary suspicion
of artifice. As it was, it held his attention long
enough for him to notice that the hair covering her
head luxuriantly was a raven black, and was gathered
beneath the hood of a soft brown sealskin fur,
which clothed her form, while two wonderful opal
bracelets, relieved with ruby jewels, in alternating
links, most incongruously graced her wrists, the
gloves on her fingers were evidently distended by
rings, and a superb necklace of diamonds and
peridots encircled closely her neck, seen through
the half-opened cape. Leacraft rose mechanically
to his feet, still conscious of effort, and looked wonderingly
at the young face, and at that of her companion,
Mr. Thomsen, the Scotchman.</p>

<p>“My cousin and I”—the voice was exquisitely
gentle and expressive—“can never repay you. It
is a slight thing to say to you how much we thank
you, but it is not impossible that we can both yet
show you our gratitude in some manner that will
mean more than words, mean as much for you as
your sacrifice meant for us. Is not that so, Ned?”</p>

<p>She turned to Mr. Thomsen, who advanced and
accosted Leacraft with courteous alacrity. “I am
sure, sir, you appreciate our sense of devotion to
yourself. You extricated my cousin and myself
from a certain and dangerous imprisonment. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
might have been something more dreadful. And
perhaps,” with a reluctant gaze at the young woman,
and a smile of understanding for Leacraft,
“you may wish to understand better how the perilous
predicament you found us in occurred. It
was very simple. This lady, Miss Ethel Tobit,”
Leacraft bowed, “was left with myself, her cousin,
at the home of her father and mother, on Pitt
street, to complete the packing of a quantity of valuables
which were at the last moment to be placed
in a safe and left there for recovery later; it does
now seem as if that word was a poor mask for
Never. We had brought food for the house, and
felt no fears of escaping before the streets became
impassable. Then this last storm broke, and this
afternoon, late in the day, we started out—but we
had waited too long. My cousin sank under the
exertion; I was disabled by a fall, in which my
side was seriously bruised. We took refuge in St.
Andrew’s Church, whose doors stood providently
unclosed, though to swing them out I had to dig
with my hands a crevice for their movement, in the
rising snow banks forcing them constantly back.
Our vigil began. The city in all directions around
us was deserted. We could hear the workers on
Princes street occasionally, in the lulls of the hurricane,
and the whistle from the station sent thrills
of anguish through us, as we felt we should soon be
alone in an empty city. It was as impossible for us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
in our crippled state to return to the house in Pitt
street as to reach Princes street. We then began
calling, and it was you, sir, who responded. I
think hunger and thirst would have made it impossible,
even in the day, for us to have left our
retreat, and only <span class="locked">the—”</span></p>

<p>“Don’t, Ned,” cried the quivering girl; “don’t
don’t! It’s too awful to think of. We need all our
best spirits as it is—but to think—Oh! it’s too horrible!”
And she hid her face against her cousin’s
breast, and broke into sobs. Leacraft felt the embarrassment,
and was ill at ease, though somehow
at that mournful moment the sight of a beautiful
woman seemed a compensation, and in this case, as
she lifted her tearful face to Leacraft, piteously
struggling to smile, it awoke in him a kind of ardor
to be always near her. He looked almost tenderly
at her and said: “I think I have every reason
to thank my good fortune and this remarkable
weather for a very pleasant adventure. Well,
No!” he continued, as he caught the reproachful
and grieving glance of Miss Tobit, “that is too
cynical. Heaven knows we are all broken-hearted
enough to-night to relinquish any false gayety, or
even the appearance of it, but certainly, Miss
Tobit, I hope this chance acquaintance will establish
a friendship between us. It will be the only
compensation for this night of agony, and perhaps
for all the other nights of agony that still await us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
You will not refuse it?”</p>

<p>Miss Tobit turned instinctively to her friend, and
Leacraft, betrayed into an earnestness perhaps
somewhat out of place, had a fleeting glance of
an evanescent smile, and then the words, even more
sweetly spoken than at first, came to his ears:</p>

<p>“It would be all your own fault if we fail to be
friends. I am sure I can keep my side of the contract.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thomsen watched this brief exchange of
promises not altogether with approval, if the faintly
forming frown on his face meant anything, and
the evident inclination to take Miss Tobit away
from Leacraft’s proximity. But he was entirely
courteous, and with a half-whispered comment that,
“It would not do now to tire their benefactor any
more,” he moved off and drew the lady with him.
And then the summons came from the other end
of the room that all was in readiness, that Sir John
was on the train, and that the attempt to reach the
south was to be made. There was much confusion
and some indecent precipitation to gain the door,
and in the rush Leacraft lost sight of his newly
made friends, but found, to his great satisfaction,
Jim at his side, for Jim had turned out to be that
sort of a fellow that meets predicaments with coolness,
and quietly, without words, instills confidence.</p>

<p>Leacraft was a little nettled over his seriousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
with Miss Tobit, because it revealed again to himself
that prosaic stiffness of language which he consciously
recognized as having formed an element
of failure with Miss Garrett, whose plastic wit
found in it a source of amusement. He walked towards
the door, wondering bitterly why women
placed so much value on a turn of speech, or the
accent of a compliment, when his musing discontent
was interrupted by a hand laid on his arm. He
turned around and saw a member of the Common
Council of the city, associated with Sir John C—
in the last days of the city’s government. The
stranger accosted him. “Mr. Leacraft, the Provost
Marshal wishes you to share his compartment. He
has a great desire to speak with you on the affairs
of the city, and the dreadful things which seem to
be before us. This way, sir,” and he motioned to
a large parlor coach in the centre of the train.</p>

<p>Leacraft retained him. Placing his hand on
Jim’s shoulder, he said, “This man goes with me.”
The councilman for a moment looked puzzled, but
almost instantly rejoined, “Certainly, sir; your
personal attendants are welcome.”</p>

<p>Leacraft laughed and exclaimed, “No, sir, this
is no personal attendant of mine. This is only a
brave man, whom I am proud to call my friend,”
and as he turned to Jim the latter gave him a glance
of the sincerest gratitude and pride.</p>

<p>The councilman waived the privilege of questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
and nodding vigorously his assent, led Leacraft
and Jim to the car of Sir John.</p>

<p>It was a car of an American type, and comfortably
provided with couches and seats, tables and
easy chairs. A number of men were already in it,
and some refreshments, with the circulation of bottles
of Scotch whiskey, showed Leacraft the unappeasible
claims of man’s appetite, even in the ruins
of his own fortune.</p>

<p>Sir John occupied a chair at a round table in a
further corner of the compartment, and as Leacraft
made his way towards him, the eyes of the
city’s chief gazed at him in return with inexpressible
weariness and sadness. Leacraft motioned Jim
to a seat, and took the proffered hand of Sir John,
who let his arm fall heavily on the table, and still
kept his eyes fixed on Leacraft, motionless and silent.
It was Leacraft who first spoke:</p>

<p>“I think, Sir John, that it was a few years ago
that I secured your intervention for a poor fellow
who was condemned offhand, and you were willing
to help me turn the law back in its course, that it
might have an opportunity to find out what it was
made for—murder or justice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do recall it, and, Mr. Leacraft, do you
know,” replied Sir John, “that that day seems unmercifully
far away. It seems as if you and I lived
then in another world, and as if we perhaps had
died, and were living in quite a different one now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
and one very much worse, however bad the old one
was. I am too dazed with all this. I feel as if I
must wake up and find it all a horrible nightmare.
But there can be no excuse for self-deception with
me. I have studied this question. I am one of the
most convinced that Scotland is doomed. Yes,”
and the speaker straightened himself with a movement
of exhaustion, “that England is doomed, too,
that we are about to see primal conditions returning
which are normal physiographic states, but
which will destroy our civilization. Listen,” and
as Leacraft sank into a chair near him, he leaned
again upon the table and spoke with a sort of eager
impatience at his own logic, as if he invited and expected
and hoped for contradiction. “Listen. The
isothermals as they existed before this calamity
were a travesty on the map; they were an outrage
upon meteorological symmetry. See here,” and
Sir John drew out a portfolio which he opened on
the table before him; he opened it and displayed a
Mercator projection of the world.</p>

<p>He was about to continue when a shout, which
had mingled with it a throb of grief, like a loud
wail, entered their ears—Leacraft noticed at the
moment that the train was moving; it had been
moving for some time. He looked out of the compartment
window. “We are leaving Edinburgh,”
his voice sank to a sympathetic whisper, as Sir
C— suddenly turned to gaze, too, along with all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
rest, upon the shrouded city.</p>

<p>The snow was falling from a leaden sky, and the
mantled city, with its higher buildings, here a
spire, there a monument, like an irregular mound
hiding a burial, was indistinctly, very partially,
seen. The men and one woman—the Scotch girl
saved that afternoon from the tomb of snow—were
standing in the coaches, leaning out of the open
windows, to fathom the dull, mottling obscurity
of the air, to catch—to be forever remembered—some
recognized feature of the great, beautiful
habitation now left in the on-coming night time,
to be buried in the whirling wreaths. Hidden between
its hills, imperishable but unseen, and waiting
for its resurrection again into the joy of life
and usefulness—a dead city, save for those brigands
who, like wolves or ghouls, dared death to
fatten on abandoned riches, amid its solemn, terrifying
loneliness! Strange vicissitude! and as Leacraft
descried, in a blurred exaggeration of its natural
size, the dome of St. George’s Church, opposite
the Albert Memorial, a voice somewhere among
the tearful and dumb gazers repeated this verse
from Burns’ invocation to the honored and historic
site:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though the train made a toilsome way and interrupted
progress, with steam sweepers ahead of it,
the city soon faded away. The eye could not long
pierce that forest of descending veils of snow, the
sepulchre would soon be accomplished, and the
spectators shuddered at the thought of those voluntarily
immured and hapless wretches, who had
seized this chance for a few hours’ reckless pleasure,
and then—their own death, murdered by each
other’s hand in the furious combat for survival,
or choked with the many fingers of the frost at
their necks. And Leacraft remained at the window
still looking, while Sir John patiently waited, staring
at his map, or raising his eyes expectantly to
Leacraft, to resume his attention.</p>

<p>A bitter thought passed through Leacraft’s mind.
Edinburgh had been faithless. Dressed in beauty,
rich in reputation, nurtured in elegance and culture,
she had been wickedly selfish. Her streets
were filled with embruted men and women, with the
vassals of drink and depravity; her picturesque
quarters hid misery and vulgar need, unsanitary
and simply mean corners of wretchedness, filled
with creatures to whom life was an uneasy mixture
of sleep and drunkenness. She had done nothing
for these. Her life was part of the life of the whole
kingdom, and the word of that life was selfishness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
the stupid adhesion to conventional usage which
kept the land from the people, which loaded taxes
and rents upon a slaving many, for the perpetuation
of an indulgent and luxurious life to the few. The
upper surfaces of society, brilliant and dazzlingly
sleek with pride, and puffed up with the vanity
of knowledge, cushioned upon a contemptuous forgetfulness
of duty, of sympathy, conceitedly viewing
their reflections in Burke’s Peerage, or Chalmer’s
Landed Gentry, begrudging every concession
to modern sense of justice, denying the equality of
men, fostering the silly homage of their inferiors,
and rankly gathering around the idiocy of a futile
monarchy. It was a class life, a class gospel, a
class cultus, the arrogance of a classification of the
humans of society, which made the joy of the world
the prerogative of those who by birth or fortune
found themselves foreordained to possess it, and
who now—God willing—would fight every inch of
their vantage ground to keep that advantage, believing
that a fine suavity of demeanor, a generous
support of fashion, a supercilious deference to
education as an aristocratic embellishment, a pretentious
clemency of judgement and an unfailing
church attendance, would save them before any supernatural
tribunal—if indeed such a tribunal existed—of
particular blame. Those among them yet
endowed with the pulses of human feeling, gentle
in spirit and blessed with the better sentimentalities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
of religion, visited the poor, and dropped lunch
baskets at their doors, and assumed the fine benison
of stooping angels—a shallow thoughtlessness
which did nothing for the regeneration of permanent
social outrages. The unemployed might clamor,
the poor might continue to multiply, and the
young and ambitious might sail away on white
wings to the new life of America, but the lord and
landlord must still remain, because in the sight of
the Lord God Almighty the lord and the landlord
are part and parcel of the eternal order of things,
an appanage of His eternal throne and a reflection
of the rule of Heaven. And beneath all this was the
sickly obsequiousness and snuffling adoration of ordinary
men, which of course the lord and ladies despised,
but which after all was helpful in keeping
up the distinguished humbug.</p>

<p>This on its best side, but there was a worse side.
There was moral depravity; there was ruthless
wickedness; there was a set so smart that they defied
decency and rectitude, and travelled on the
currents of their passions to all the maelstroms of
moral rottenness. The King himself had violated
the measures of sobriety and faithfulness. And
this imposing and historical structure, must now
totter to its fall before the drifting snowflake.
Truly the simple shall confound the wise. Leacraft
turned from his melancholy thoughts to the friendly
face of Sir John, who, catching his eye, resumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
his conversation.</p>

<p>“This map will make it quite plain that the
position of our nation as a commercial, as a political
fabric, is a geographical absurdity, a necessary
paradox. Look!” and Sir John pinned down
the map on the table, and drew Leacraft
down towards its attentive examination. “Here!
is an occular demonstration of our false
position, a charted proof that we are in a
wrong place, a spot of possible change, that will
reverse all previous experiences if the right conditions
supervene. The change has come, and Scotland
returns to its appointed allegiance. It belongs
to the Kings of the Ice. See,” and he leaned over the
map in a kind of ecstacy of despair, speaking rapidly
as his fingers traced the lines he indicated. “See!
consider these enormities. Land’s End and the
Scilly Islands, where palms grow, are on the degree
of 50 degree north latitude, which is the same as
Notre Dame Bay in New Foundland, the same as
Manitoba, the same as the most northern Kurile
Islands. Do you know what the temperature of
these places are? I will tell you. The average
winter temperature of northern New Foundland
is 10 degrees, that of Manitoba 9 degrees, and that
of the Kurile Islands, 12 degrees.</p>

<p>“The average temperature of Land’s End is 40
degrees. Well, that may not strike you as a contrast
so sharp as to warrant my dire prediction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
but you must learn to see in average temperatures
much more than is simply indicated in the mere
differences in degrees. Averages are utterly misleading,
so far as they mean habitable conditions.
A temperature of 0 for six months, and a temperature
of 80 degrees, for the remaining six months
furnishes the harmless average of 40 degrees, but
a land suffering from the affliction of a climate
such as that, would be useless for the larger purposes
of a civilized community. Averages produce
an impression of uniformity, whereas they conceal
the most obstreperous changes—and a small difference,
such as you observe between the temperature
of the Scilly islands, and these inclement and impossible
districts of Canada or Kamtchatka, means
that though all are on the same latitude, they are as
diversely adapted for modern life as the tropics
and the north pole. Why are the Scilly islands
adapted for tulips and spring peas, when Manitoba
yet sleeps in snow?</p>

<p>“From the point of view of a primary instruction
in temperature, hottest at the equator, coldest
at the pole, and graded all the way between; it is
a preposterous caprice. It is a caprice. And a
civilization flourishing under the auspices of a
caprice, will come to grief. Climate is a symbol
of vagaries, contradictions and sudden affinities.
It is the atmospheric expression for the feminine
and the poetic in men. As a matter of fact contingencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
of interfering land surfaces, of changing
barometric pressure, of oceanic tides, of air
currents, of solar radiation, combine into a labyrinth
of possibilities to make places that ought to
be cold, hot, and vice versa.</p>

<p>“But they are evanescent possibilities, and the
founders of empires who rely on them will some
day be brought back with stunning, abject terror,
as we now are, to the realization of first principles,
that latitudes are invincible barriers to the diffusion
of the race, and that the nations neglecting
their plain meaning court disaster. Well; you
know the explanation of all these whims of nature.
The old story; the Gulf Stream with its millions of
units of heat forced northward by wind pressure,
and accelerated eastward by the equatorial velocity
it starts out with, our insular position bathed in
oceanic waters, holding immense deposits of the
sun’s heat; the open seas north of us; the great
furnace stores of heat in Africa, like a nearby factory
heating our thin coasts. That is common
knowledge—but these accidents of position, these
migratory tides are holding in check invincible tendencies.
Like a child’s push against an evenly
balanced boulder they keep off the descent of disaster,
but like another child’s push in the opposite
direction, a sudden alteration of coast lines reduces
our boasted exemption to a shadow, and London,
Edinburgh, Liverpool, Glasgow, Paris, Amsterdam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Berlin, Hamburgh—the great cities of the
world—pay at last the penalty of an infringement
of nature’s Common Law.</p>

<p>“Heat is life, and cold is death, and no blank
optimism may hope for national achievement in the
frosts of winter. Our civilization, the civilization
of northern Europe, has overstepped the limits of
climatic permission, as this globe is made. We are
the victims of a deception. Primary conditions of
temperature are returning, a meteorological hoax
is exploded, and 50 degrees north latitude will
mean in Europe what it has always meant elsewhere.
But look at Edinburgh, look at these isothermals
on the map, attributing to her the temperature
of far southern latitudes. Too obvious an absurdity
to last. True enough. Yes, but fugitive;
an episode only. So flat a contradiction of the
economy of this round earth should never have
misled us. And we have had <span class="locked">warnings—”</span></p>

<p>Mr. C— stopped; his agitation fairly choked
him. Leacraft sympathized with the gentleman’s
distress. His bitterness of heart had created a
mental hallucination, an unbalanced affectation of
epigram. Leacraft interposed: “Well, Sir John,
the empire of Great Britain has no reason to regret
its existence, even if it is based on a climatic fallacy.
There have been some things done in it
which no change in temperature will obliterate, unless
the Ice Age is returning and we all decline into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
extinction north and south, and the Earth is again
without form and void. You speak of caprices.
How can you tell this is not a caprice, too, a monstrous
subterfuge of Nature to teach us a lesson, letting
us come back again when we are better, when
we can feel and keep grateful to Her for letting us
live at all. You err in deduction Sir John. A
round Earth exposed to the sun’s heat with a zenith
movement from 23,28 north latitude to 23,28
south latitude, must exhibit water currents flowing
north, and bringing with them equatorial temperatures.
Such a fact is as normal as that the same
earth must be colder at the poles than at the equator.
You are involved in a sophism, because you assume
a principle which is imaginary, so far as its
invariable truth is concerned.</p>

<p>“And what warnings have we ever had?”</p>

<p>“Warnings!” said Sir John, after a moment’s
silence during which he regarded Leacraft with a
guarded hopefulness, “Warnings! Many.” And
he took out a note book from which he read. “The
winters of 1544, 1608, 1709, were terrific—the thermometer
at Paris in 1709, sank to nine degrees below
zero Fah. In 1788–1789, the river Seine froze
over in November. Then there was 1794–5, 1798–9,
when the rivers of Europe were frozen over. In
1795, the mercury in Paris registered ten degrees
below zero, although at the same time in London the
temperature was nearly seven degrees above zero.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
And then we have 1812–3 when Napoleon failed,
defeated by the cold rather than the Russians. In
1819–20, in 1829–30, in 1840–41, in 1853–4, 1870–71,
during the Franco-German war, with the cold
greater at the south than in the north of France,
and when—this is worth noting—the Gulf Stream
was driven backward by a north wind, and banked
up, as it were, at Spain and Portugal; in all these
years there were intensely cold winters, which if
continued, and reinforced by storms, and increased
by the disappearance of some of the helpful agencies
that now keeps up our supply of caloric, would
mean, could only mean our extinction.</p>

<p>“Now as for degrees of cold—I quote from Flammarion—‘the
greatest cold yet experienced has
been twenty-four degrees below zero in France, five
degrees below in England, twelve below in Belgium
and Holland, sixty-seven degrees in Denmark, Sweden
and Norway, forty-six in Russia, thirty-two in
Germany, ten degrees below in Spain and Portugal.’
These are Fahrenheit records. These severities
tell us our danger.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” rejoined Leacraft, “that they
tell us nothing of the sort. It is a mild madness to
misconstrue them so completely. These extremes of
temperatures are far lower than any we have observed,
and yet we have been expelled from Scotland.
It is the snow. These endless heaping torrents
from the skies that have driven us out, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
they—I do believe it—will continue; but it has no
parallel. Nothing warned us of this—and as to our
climatic safety, it was as fixed as the change of day
to night when, without warning, without precedent,
a bridge of mountains tumbles into a hole in the sea,
another bridge rises as a dam, and either occurrence
seemed about as likely as that the moon would fall
into the sun. I think indeed the advantage of a
guess might have lain with the latter supposition.”</p>

<p>“Well. The snow; you say it will continue,” said
Sir John with a sudden reflex action of revolt.
“Why will it continue?”</p>

<p>“I estimate the probability for that in this way,”
answered Leacraft. “The atmosphere is a system
of balances never at rest, unless in equilibrium, and
never in equilibrium except at rare intervals, and
then in limited and favored spots. This state of
inequilibrium causes constant motion, currents,
storms, winds and precipitation, whether of rain or
snow, depending on temperature and position. Now
the motor power of the movement in all this atmospheric
mass is difference of temperature, the hot
air rising and flowing to the poles, and the cold air
of the poles descending and flowing to the equator.
That is the A. B. C. of meteorological physics. But
the revolution of the earth causes the cold polar
winds to blow from the northeast and the warm
equatorial winds to blow from the southwest, that is
with reference to our position in the northern hemisphere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
Now if we are undergoing a progressive
refrigeration, the contrast in temperatures between
our latitude and the temperature of the equator increases,
and because of that, the velocity of the wind
blowing from the latter increases too, and the moisture
that these winds would have dropped over
the equatorial zones is carried further north, and
our annual precipitation is thereby increased—our
snow falls become more continuous and thicker.
Think what the removal of the Gulf Stream means.
Croll has clearly shown that the heat bearing capacity
of the Gulf Stream is enormous. It seems incredible.
I recall some of his statements. He says
that the Gulf Stream conveys as much heat as is
received from the sun by over one million and a
half square miles at the equator, and the amount
thus conveyed is equal to all the heat which falls upon
the globe within thirty-two miles on each side of
the equator; further that the quantity of heat conveyed
by the Gulf Stream in one year is equal to the
heat which falls, on an average, on three millions
and a half square miles of the arctic regions, and
that there is actually therefore nearly one-half as
much heat transferred from tropical regions by the
Gulf Stream as is received from the sun by the entire
Arctic regions, the quantity conveyed from the
tropics by the stream to that received from the sun
by the Arctic regions being nearly as two to five.
And it is this fact of the tremendous drain that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
Gulf Stream makes on the equatorial regions, those
immense manufactories of heat, that its removal—meaning
the sudden abstraction of this heat or
much of it from our latitude—produces a more
forceful interchange in the airs of the north and the
south. It produces winds of a higher velocity, and
because of this, the wind coming to us from the
Equator does not so quickly free itself of its contained
moisture. Croll has shown in his splendid
work of theory and proof, that the winds warmed
by the Gulf stream are the true causes for our unusual
and exceptional heat above corresponding positions
on the western side of the Atlantic basin.
The Gulf Stream gone, these warming winds will
bring us heat no longer. But they will bring us
moisture, and in larger quantities, and then the process
of refrigeration over our chilled coasts will
turn that into snow. The snows will be deeper, and
they will last longer. In this way, Croll, defending
himself against the criticism of Findlay, shows that
the winds—the anti-trades blowing from the south
to replace the atmospheric emptiness—I suppose we
might say vacuum—left by the descent of the cold
winds from the poles, parted with the most of their
moisture in the equatorial belt. Now by reason of
their greater velocity they will not do that; they
will reach us much less despoiled of their watery
burdens.</p>

<p>“Our highlands and our coast position make us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
natural condensers. To-day we have a rainfall in
the year of about thirty inches. That may now be
doubled. The southwest winds are our most general
winds. Out of a thousand as a maximum, during
the year, two hundred and twenty-five are from
the southwest. These are wet winds. And in the
same total there are one hundred and eleven south
winds which also carry moisture, making a possible
percentage of one third of all the winds that blow
over us as rain winds, or now by reason of our altered
state as snow makers. But this relative frequency
will now be increased. There will be a longer
continuation of the west winds, because as I
have suggested they will be stronger. They are
to-day most intense in the winter months. Our
south and southwest winds gather moisture from
a wide expanse of sea, the same expanse from
which they formerly gathered heat from the Gulf
Stream was widely diffused over the north Atlantic,
both north and south, for as Croll shows, by reason
of a high barometric pressure somewhere off
the west of Maderia and a low pressure north of
Iceland, the tendency of the air south of the English
Isles at that point is to flow north. But these winds
are no longer heat carriers. They bring moisture
only. They bear to us through the air the winding
sheets of our burial.”</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, and it was a
look of anguish. The sudden cruel dreadfulness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
the hideous mutation which might send the English
people out of their land on the strange quest for a
new home crushed them into an emotional inanition.
They did not seem to exist. Their lips lost
their color, and only the paralysis of stupor saved
them from breaking down into sobs.</p>

<p>It was a few moments later that Leacraft spoke.
He asked, “And the people of Glasgow. How did
they get away?”</p>

<p>Sir John Clarke scarcely raised his head and his
words scarcely formed an articulate whisper;
“They went by steamers.”</p>

<span class="subhead">IN LONDON, FEBRUARY, 1910.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the smoking room of the Bothwell Club, on
Cheapside, back of St. Paul’s, London, on February
12th, in the year of grace, 1910, two men sat in attitudes
of earnest attention. A third man older than
either with his back to a blazing fire, whose simulated
effect of comfort arose from the curling tendrills
of gas flames that swept over another simulation
of heaped up logs, was speaking with desperate
emphasis. He seldom looked at his arrested
auditors, nor indeed moved, except when he raised
his head, and his eyes, strained with a hopeless
longing, sought the gay frescoes of the ceiling, or
when, in pauses of his declamations, he walked to a
window and raising the curtain looked out upon the
city, up to the dome of St. Paul’s, which rose like
an Irkutsk igloo above a plain of snow.</p>

<p>The man was Alexander Leacraft, the auditors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
were Mr. Archibald Edward Thomsen and Jim
Skaith, both familiar to the reader as rescued and
rescuing, in that awful day of November 28th,
when the last little band of citizens, led by the provost-marshal,
had slipped away in the storm from
Edinburgh. Strange things had happened since
then: much stranger were in store. The train in
which Sir John C— and his companions escaped,
had made its way with painful slowness, and
before the English line was reached had stopped
repeatedly until it was necessary to desert it. And
then the weary crowd of refugees had staggered
on their way to a distant station, along a
country side emptied of its inhabitants, with the
low houses of the country people evident only as
mounds of snow. And, with many struggles, with
mutual assistance, with prayers and suffering, the
men pushed on in the closest companionship,
brought by the terrors and dangers of the journey
into the usual unhesitating intimacy of peril. They
took each other’s places in the work of excavation,
helped all to flounder and press through the drifts,
divided their company into the weak and strong,
and so allotted tasks that the co-operation of all
helped their common progress. Camps were made
in which shelters were clumsily provided, with
tents brought from Edinburgh, and which only the
industry of the watchers saved also from burial in
the tossing drifts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>The frugal meals snatched by chance or at the
favorable moments where inequalities of the
ground permitted a more regular distribution and
preparation of food served well enough. Now and
then they espied a deserted house, and into this
they crowded, enjoying the heat of fires made of the
wood-work, the floors and windows of the house itself,
while they dried their clothing, changed their
shoes, and, gaining a respite and new strength, salleyed
out again into the desolate landscape with its
blue gray skies flaming with crimson, when the day
set, and the snow cleared, and a sharpened icy edge
of cold vibrated like an unseen but intensely realized
cord stretched nippingly through the air. The
leaders expected to reach a place called Tway stone,
where a train was in waiting, which would carry
them south of this immediate zone of the greatest
snow falls. Grewsome sights were encountered,
and the blanched faces of men turned away from
the uncovered sepulchre of a horse and rider, now
a child and mother, and sometimes in the wet morasses
still unfrozen, beneath the towering ridges,
the forlorn, immured body of a young woman with
blanketed face and streaming hair.</p>

<p>Leacraft and Thomsen, with Jim, worked unremittingly
with the young Scotch woman. They
patched up a rude litter and they carried her on
this, trudging toilsomely along, and watching her
needs. Their care was affectionate and touching,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
and soon other strong men offered their help, for
gradually the sensation gained place—so quickly
does the human fancy cling to the vaporous skirts
of superstition—that the girl’s safety meant the
rescue of all, that her security carried with it the
common weal. She became a fetich, and they rejoiced
in caring for her, as if contribution to her
welfare conveyed its unseen benefits to all who engaged
in the kind ministry. Nor did she fail, with
the living hopefulness of youth, and with her fresh
winning loveliness, to establish a return. Her
smile, the lingering gratitude she showed to all,
her own usefulness and ready help at the stop and
waiting places when her eager intelligence watched
and directed the provisioning and cooking, rewarded
the toilers. She was quick and resourceful,
cheerful in exhortation and advice, and certainly—to
Leacraft—always lovely. Thomsen had forgotten
his first resentment at Leacraft’s apparent admiration
for his cousin. The two men had become
very intimate. Both felt themselves on the edge of
new events, which were in part to be shaped by the
blind forces of the earth, and in larger part as they
affected England, by the sagacity and steadfastness
of men. They talked much over these things
together. Both were sombre and frightened. The
invincible powers of nature, the unconquerable ferocity
of nature which is deaf to reason, blind to suffering,
made them shrink and quail. To meet its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
urgency with make shifts was impossible, to resist
it madness; the line of retreat was the only line of
escape. They felt this; the thought became oppressively
dominant. They began at first to hint at it,
they ended, quite quickly too, in predicting it with
mutual confessions of dismay.</p>

<p>Both loved Miss Tobit, yet, as far as appearances
went, only the guardian spirit of her dreams
could have told the direction of her inclinations.
Perhaps both seemed to her too dear, too much involved
in the one peril with herself, to stand apart
from each other in any guise or place of preference.
Thomsen was the younger man, and he had the advantage
of a handsome face, a fine form and a particularly
deferential tenderness. Cupid and his
mother are not slow to give such gifts their heartiest
commendation. But Thomsen was generous to
his somewhat reticent, and, probably not greatly
feared rival, the prowess of beauty is generally undaunted
and oftentimes magnanimous.</p>

<p>When the worst hardships of their journey were
over, and in the less afflicted regions of England,
where at the time the snow falls were not as deep,
or the winds as tempestuous, Leacraft had many
chances to talk with Miss Tobit, and he found her
extremely affable, well informed and sympathetic,
certainly not endowed with the mischievous drollery
and the roguish merriment of Miss Garrett,
and therefore not so piquant, tantalizing, and desirable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
but very kindly and soothing.</p>

<p>The provost-marshal and most of the party went
to Liverpool, whither, before, many of the inhabitants
of Edinburgh had fled, but Leacraft and
Thomsen kept on to London. They found conditions
in London full of fright and trepidation, and
the business interests floundering and collapsed.
Leacraft took up his headquarters at the Bothwell
Club, and Thomsen and his cousin found a home at
a maiden aunt’s, in Claverhouse place.</p>

<p>But much as Leacraft would have craved an indulgence
of sympathy and response, the audience of
sense and appreciation, and the agreeable picture
before his eyes of acquiescent if not admiring beauty,
the fatal progress of events in the world of
England kept him away from Miss Tobit more
than he wished. These events were far from reassuring;
they were directly and successively catastrophic.
Their logic seemed inexorable; and Europe
became rigid with attention as it watched with
most varying feelings of commiseration the tightening
grasp of frost and snow, wind and tempest,
upon the destiny of England. Not that an actual
submergence beneath snowdrifts was threatened,
a hyperboreal sepulchre under which every Englishman
lay, like the Excelsior youth, “lifeless but
beautiful.”</p>

<p>No such shocking and shattering misery as had
befallen Scotland had as yet engulfed England, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
its southern counties, but the darkening
days brought more clearly to the observation of the
most recalcitrant and obtuse, the most reluctant and
temporizing, the fact that England’s climate was
approaching that of Labrador, that the restraints
of trade would soon become enormous, that its products
would be unmitigatedly diminished and restricted,
and that it could no longer raise wheat;
that its railroads, for half the year, would endure
a dangerous embargo; that its population would
perish; that its industries would undergo the most
serious curtailment; that foreign ports would absorb
its commerce, steal its prestige, insinuate
themselves, by its crippled resources, into the markets
of the earth in its place; that the ramifications
of disaster would penetrate its social, intellectual
and political life, and cloud its mental horizon with
the gaunt and stupid spectres of Torpor and Helplessness.
This monstrous dilemma submerged all
minor passions, and plunged England into the
noisiest outbreak of argument, suggestion and
panic-stricken questionings.</p>

<p>Leacraft buried himself in the questions that
now with the more forward and statesmanly thinkers
were coming to the front with relentless insistence.
Amongst these, conspicuously outstrode and
outshone the rest, H. G. Wells, the brilliant author
and prophet of the New Republicanism, whose book
had five years before roused an intense and frightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
protest from the servitors of antiquity, and
the selfish lackies of a superannuated and mythical
class system. Mr. Wells, with his trained skill in
scientific deduction and the exercised powers of
imagination, with a reckless and defiant desire to
unravel the future, with the slenderest regard for
the prejudices of religion or old-fogey political conservatism,
was now half-deluded himself with the
sudden dream of starting the English nation on
new grounds. Released from the impedimenta of
ceremonies and ruins, names and titles, furnished
with a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tabula rasa</i> where the new ideals of which
he set himself up as a sort of avatar and preacher
might most keenly set and develop themselves, he
believed—as in a measure Leacraft did himself—that
the English cultus would put on those insignia
of the coming eras which meant intellectual emancipation,
and a social and civil regime where the
greatest happiness and the widest material prosperity
would unite, in which, too, would not be
wanting a radical rearrangement of the relations
of the sexes, hinted at in the same author’s later
books, but which again, naturally, by many who
followed Mr. Wells a certain way, was indignantly
repudiated. A more dignified and august group of
men—among whom the names of Churchill,
Chamberlain, Rosebery, Balfour, Prof. Stubbs,
and Bryce led—had assembled themselves in a
council of deeply concerned and profoundly patriotic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
advisers. These men secured a very noble
elevation above the wild and unclassified miscellany
of men and women who, with cries, denunciations,
nostrums, whims, hallucinations, guesses and
queries, deluged the pages of the <i>Times</i>, stood at the
corners of the streets, where such standing was
possible in the hard weather, and preached their
fantastic mental wares. A still more obvious and
ear-assailing group were the religious zealots, who
thrive at moments of peril, filling the brains of
their listeners with adjurations, exhortations,
prayers, pictures and prophecies, for one moment
doleful with wailing execrations of past wickedness,
and the next piteously shrieking eloquent appeals
for repentance and confession.</p>

<p>The singular and amazing thing in all this was
the convinced assent given to the prediction of
Science. Whereas at first the geologists and the
meteorologists belittled and ridiculed the warnings
of the President, they now enlarged, extended and
enforced them with a greater authority, and more
illuminated reasoning. Hardly believing that the
people of England would realize this approaching
disaster, what it meant, what steps should be contemplated
to escape its worst effects, how permanent
and deep-seated were its causes, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science had
resolved itself into a body of educators. Lectures
were given where practicable, leaflets circulated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
letters published in the leading dailies, and a comprehensive
educational crusade started—and with
one object—to instill a deeper dread of the future, a
distrust of the possibility of the longer occupancy
of the British Islands, and yet a firm reliance that
under changed auspices of place, the same civilization,
with unchanged features, would still continue
to rule the world.</p>

<p>Parliament was constantly in session, and to it
the worshipful English householder and pew-renter
looked with unwavering faith, waiting for its sublime
wisdom and intrinsic patience, to devise ways
and means, and some safe policy of safety. Even
the King became earnest, perhaps a little anxious,
as among the most popular doctrinaire plebiscites
was the reiterated need of an abolition of the discarded
system of the royal household.</p>

<p>From the midst of all this confusion, organized
and disorganized movements, the collapse of trade,
the desertion of workers, the sudden emergence of
a thousand voices claiming, clamoring, debating, the
physical wreck of business, the inflamed transcendentalism
that saw ahead of the present moment, re-adjudication,
rehabilitation, renovation of all social
wrongs; and with the cruel winter breathing
its desolating rigors, the snow rising in the streets,
the poor dying from starvation or exposure, the
steamers crowded to their taffrails, daily exporting
the timid and selfish rich, or the pinched poor, escaping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
with a bare competency, to establish themselves
under less penurious skies—from all this
there suddenly grew into stalwart and national
proportions, <em>the resolve to leave England</em>.</p>

<p>It grew with a certain flaming ardor of noble
hopes and resolves. It grew also with an agony of
doubt. The whole implication of the idea was
grievously wounding to pride, and it strained at
the very heart-string of the English nature. To
go away from England was to become
<em>un-Englished</em>, to lose the rich heritage of pastoral
beauty, the treasured wealth of historic associations,
the spot and home of literary triumphs, the
soil, the air, which by some impalpable union of
efficacies made the English blood and temperament,
and which could not be taken away to make the
same fine product elsewhere. The pathos of it! A
nation wandering homeless with its Lares and Penates
in its arms, its face darkened with humiliation;
its shoulders, that erstwhile bore the burdens
of states, bowed with the shame of enforced desertion;
its voice, that summoned the freemen of the
earth to convocation, silent with fear, or perhaps
broken by the irrepressible echo wrung from its
own anguish, at turning its back on the cradle and
the home of its greatness.</p>

<p><em>And yet it grew</em>—this same resolve—and eloquence,
and poetry, and prayers, and science, and
statescraft united to make it strong and beautiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
to blend in it the supernatural benisons of religion,
the purified affections of the heart, and the resolute
affirmations of conviction.</p>

<p>“My friends,”—it was Leacraft speaking from
the fireside of the Bothwell Club, in Cheapside, on
the night of February 12th, 1910—“I think the
speech to-day of the members from Scotland in Parliament
was decisive. It leaves no alternative. We
cannot hopelessly, in the face of this modern
world’s competition, fight out a narrowing chance
for existence under the conditions facing us. And
it is an unmistakable alternative. Our climate has
changed, and the change is irrevocable, and it is
subversive, too. We must go away, taking all that
we have with us. The English nation has reached a
sublime crisis. We transplant our virtues; we will
relinquish our failings; we have a world of our
own to choose from, and we are given an opportunity
unparalleled in history.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great chance to begin all over again,” expostulated
Jim.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” resumed Leacraft, his voice rising
with that peculiar English intonation of tenuity,
which often animates their sluggist accents, if it
does not soon soar into nasal squeaks;—“Not at
all. We leave England with not a thing forgotten
or lost. The machinery of our greatness is in
our history, and in ourselves; the products of industry
and art, so far as they are necessary fixtures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
stay. What of it—a cathedral, a palace here and
there? They often stand for things it would be best
for us to forget, and under which perhaps only
revolution and violence will make us forget, if we
remain as we are. What stirs my imagination,
what grows visibly before me”—both Thomsen
and Jim watched intently the fervid Englishman,
released into a sort of mystic clairvoyance—“is a
new land which is a physical unit, which has known
no political subdivision, which holds within it no
inherited rages, and taunting bitternesses, as these
islands do to-day. Let it be Australia, let it be
South Africa—though there, I admit, is the memory
of a bungle—but we enter it a single people,
blended into homogeneity by adversity, and we set
about the tremendously interesting task of re-creating
England, at least in all things pertaining to
her that are great and lovable.”</p>

<p>“I fail to see,” said Thomsen, “that the probabilities
are that way. On the contrary, freed from
the geographical confinement of neighboring islands
governed from London, in a new land, Irish,
Scotch, English will segregate again, and then
scatter, just as might mixed races of birds, who,
while they are in the same cage mingle, but when
they fly out, fall back into their natural groups, by
the most certain of all animal tendencies, that ‘like
seeks like.’”</p>

<p>“Well, and what of it?” retorted Leacraft.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
“These elements are together in a new country. It
is one. There is no history behind it of subjugation
and ill treatment; there can be no reversion
to bickerings and recriminations where even the
monuments and milestones familiarly associated
with injustice have disappeared. Besides, we leave
behind the obnoxious, shameless law of entail—at
least we shall be free of that disgrace—and at last—but,”
he added, his voice again sinking to a
pained whisper, “with what a wrench!”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Leacraft,” spoke up Jim Skaith again,
“it’s mair than moving that has to be done. There’s
the new land to be bought and settled. There’s getting
there, and biding there. There’s schools to
be built, and hames and shops, and, it seems to me,
with pardon for being so forward, that if it took so
many years to make a great city, it’s no fule’s wark
to sail ower the seas and pit it up again”; then,
after a pause, “An’ it’s never the auld hame.”</p>

<p>“No,” resumed Leacraft, “that is true. It’s
not the old home, and a big city—the greatest—cannot
be boxed up in straw and packing cloth
and get set up by order in another place, with the
precision of a movable bungalow. But we need not
trifle. We all know that it’s no child’s work. We
expect something very different from London. We
can meet the emergencies of place and room. Our
population can be distributed. Remember, we are
on trial, and the new, strange chapter opening before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
us will bring again into view the inalienable
fortitude and power of the English mind. It’s a
test. The conditions are irreversible, and mind
and character will win—must win—or slowly,
surely, the stars of our ascendancy pale and disappear.
Nature for a moment has thrown us in a
great peril, but was it nature or ourselves that won
us footholds throughout the world? Open coasts
await us, hundreds of thousands will welcome us.
The influences of a common language, ancestry and
institutions have chained together the links of our
supremacy around the world, and made of it an
inseparable girdle. Shall we falter now, when nature
again challenges our mind to quell her hostility,
opposing her impediments of sense to our invisible
treasuries of thought, invention and self-confidence?
It is a new step—our best step,—in
the march of human liberty. We need to be divorced
from the material constants, amid which the
long fought battle for free thought and action has
been waged. We are yet entangled in the meshes
of tradition, the stumbling blocks of convention—and
now they are shattered. We rise to splendid
hopes. Or shall we say it is retribution, it is punishment
for many sins. Let it be so. A chastened
pride will not hurt us, nor will it hurt our chances.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Leacraft,” interrupted Thomsen, “I feel
better to hear you talk this way, but I must look at
some very disagreeable facts, too. They are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
easily eliminated by words or fancies, and even
seem to evince a provoking facility to become more
numerous, the more they are considered. Take the
mechanical problem of transportation. We are
some forty millions of people. The extravagant
powers of assimilation of the United States barely
digests the one million of emigrants that come to
their shores each year; what conceivable powers of
absorption will dispose of our forty millions without
an attack of industrial <em>gastritis</em> that will induce
the worst political convulsions. And the carrying
skill and capacity of our whole merchant
marine cannot in less than ten years take away
this monstrous human cargo, together with all the
colossal accumulation of paraphernalia, stocks,
chattels, goods, treasures, books and belongings,
that have gathered in this rich island, until they
seem like a sort of pactolian alluvium that is indigenous
and irremovable. Think of the women, the
children! What method of domiciliation will you
devise to accommodate these armies? And with
this removal comes the crash of all domestic values,
railroad stock, gas stock, mill stock, warehouses,
land values, everything goes with the removal of
the human vitality that gives them worth. It staggers
the imagination to think how the disorganization
radiates and increases in all directions. In
1905–6 this Great Britain consumed in one industry
alone nearly four millions of bales of cotton, spun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
them out into merchantable goods on her fifty million
spindles. Do you measure the almost unfathomable
depths of distress the stoppage of this one
industry means? Is it not better to fight it out
here, to defeat Nature, if I may be allowed to copy
your own enthusiasm, to put on our own heads the
regalia of the Ice King, and <em>rule him</em>, wrest from
him his own sceptre, and excel his power with the
power of this new century of invention?”</p>

<p>“Impossible.” Leacraft’s retort was quick and
impetuous. “Impossible. No expedients of man
overcome the deliberate intentions of Nature. We
utilize her forces, but we may not deflect her purposes.
It is the voice of that very science which
has made us such powerful masters of her utilities
that now tells us: <em>We must go.</em> To quote the
words of Prof. Darwin, spoken at the Cape Town
meeting of the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, ‘Stability is further a property
of relationship to surrounding conditions; it
denotes adaptation to environment’; there can be
no adaptation to this new environment, which will
retain our former greatness. Nature opposes us,
indeed, in forcing us away, but we thwart her
niggardliness by subterfuge and endurance and
courage. We can make her plastic enough for our
purposes if we do not overstep the limits of her last
negation. The practical question, the panic, the
loss! Ah! Well, if all should be as it has been,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
if the inequalities still remained, the very moral
significance and regeneration which I hope for
could not come. It means the levelling process by
which the New Brotherhood is visibly and violently
enforced. And as to place and means, thousands
upon thousands will establish themselves in
America, blessing every community they enter,
and being blessed in turn with opportunity. Australia
and South Africa, and Canada, with millions
upon millions of square miles of unused land,
will furnish us with new homes. Revivification,
regeneration, rehabilitation will be rapid. We
shall not see its final outcome, but we shall know
the virile impulse of self help at its inception. If
social differences, if social pageantry, vanish, the
constraining push of Christian tolerance and fellowship
succeeds. Differences may emerge later,
but they will be differences of endowment and industrious
energy; no other. And as to the transportation
problem, it can be solved. We should not
all go at once. It may be a slow movement; perhaps
the slower the better. But see how we become
unified. Like refugees or shipwrecked outcasts, we
shall help each other, and every man’s hand will
help his neighbor, but also we shall organize on the
basis of each man’s aptitude; the farmer to his
ploughshare, the mechanic to his workshop, the
preacher to his pulpit, the artist to his easel, the
banker to his counting room; at last, an ideal assortment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
of talents.”</p>

<p>Thomsen hid a slight yawn, and made a smile of
incredulity serve the ends of a salutation of encouragement.
“There’s no denying the contagion
of your confidence, Leacraft, but really I think that
we are all mournfully in the dark as to what we best
can do; and in the meanwhile it’s a matter of positive
terror what we are going to live on. I brought
all the available cash I could for Ethel and myself,
but already famine has unfurled its banners, and
you know how cramped and shrunk our living has
become in London. The Thames alone saves us
from starvation. It’s no longer a question of having
a bank balance, but the more definite and fundamental
one of finding something to buy.</p>

<p>“By the by, Balfour closes the debate at ten to-night.
You have admission to the gallery of the
Commons. Let us go down. It promises to be a
fine effort. I only hope it’s not going to be a funeral
oration.”</p>

<p>Leacraft pulled out his watch and found the time
a half-hour after nine. Yes, he would go; in fact
he had already engaged a boatman at Blackfriars’
Bridge, to be in waiting for him at almost that very
moment. Jim stepped to the window and looked
out. The night was pure and clear. Huge hummocks
of snow encumbered the streets below, and
the moon blazed in the keen sky like some target of
disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>“Weel, Mr. Leacraft, you won’t want me along,
and somehow I’d rather sit here and think over
your own words, little as I believe it will all come
oot so gude-like.”</p>

<p>“No, Jim, keep the fire on, and watch out for us,
and you might remember to brew us a stiff snack
after your own heart; it won’t come amiss.” Jim
assented with alacrity, and Leacraft and Mr.
Thomsen, muffled up to their ears, and almost hermetically
enclosed in fur ulsters, left the room, descended
the stairs, and appeared at the doorway on
the street. A tolerable path led through a part of
Cheapside, but it was not their intention to follow
that thoroughfare; they turned towards the church
and clambered along a devious footway, that imitated
the sinuous and irregular wanderings of a
mountain trail. It led them to Ludgate Hill, where
they encountered a few other travellers like themselves
making their way to the bridge for the same
purpose. Bridge street was just passable, and soon
the ice-laden waters of the river were seen, blazoned
like some spectacle of enchantment in the deluge of
argent light. They found the boatman in the basement
of the Hotel Royal, which was dead, to the last
stories of its ornamented facade, silent and dark.
It was a part of the indications that London already
had lost its visitors. The barge men stole
out of their retreat, and Leacraft and Thomsen followed
them, the shadows of the party printed in ink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
on the winnowed snow. Two men accompanied
the boat; one rowed and the other stood at the
prow, pushing off the cakes of ice, and correcting
the passage of the boat through the lanes of water,
flowing like limpid threads of molten silver between
the crunching and veering floes. Leacraft
and Thomsen watched with fascinated eyes the
broad terrace of the Victoria Embankment, illuminated
with the moon’s effulgence, whose unchecked
glory met a feeble rivalry in a few sickly
gas mantels, and a solitary electric lamp. The noble
houses of legislation—and to the eyes of Leacraft
they never seemed more imbued with a supremely
delicate and elevating beauty—rose from
the water’s edge, like some creation of an inspired
dreamer, woven of splintered rays of light, with
pencilled lines of ebony filched from the darkest
night. It embodied a loveliness past even the powers
of thought to measure or describe. The houses
flamed with light, and the strong light on the clock
tower, announced the sitting of Parliament, sent
back to the moon a terrestrial radiance, that resembled
the pulsations of a fallen star. As they passed
the Westminster Bridge, their eyes caught the distant
lights of Lambeth Palace. Both knew that to-night
the King dined with the Archbishop.</p>

<p>Slowly their boat drew near the landing, and
the two men who guided it motioned to its occupants
to get ready to disembark, as the landing was deprived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
of its usual outfit, owing to the clogging
cakes of ice which clung to the wall. The heavy
nose of the boat was pushed into the wall, and Leacraft
and Thomsen scrambled up the steps, and
gained the walk which led to the Victoria Arch, and
the entrance of the Parliament House. Here a
jam was encountered, and the news was soon learned
that Balfour had begun his speech an hour before
the announced time, and was now engaged in
the closing appeal on the motion before the house.</p>

<p>And what was this motion? To explain it, it is
necessary to rehearse some of the preceding events,
which had finally eventuated in this most marvellous
situation; a debate in the House of Parliament
as to whether the English people should evacuate
England. This momentous and world-moving
spectacle was now actually contemplated by the
fixed attention of every nation on the earth. Its awful
solemnity, the convulsing pathos of it, the immense
commercial dislocation it involved, its social
agony, the calamitous doubts it summoned as to
the stability of Europe itself, and the fiercer sudden
question of the meaning of human existence on
this planet, it aroused, made the debate of the English
Parliament then pending the most extraordinary
discussion ever known in human annals.</p>

<p>The occasion for it had practically been forced
or precipitated by the coercive power of scientific
opinion. And the curious thing about this same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
scientific opinion was that it first resisted the
overwhelming proof of the subsidence of the isthmus
and the elevation of the Caribbean wall of
transgression, and then fervently accepted it, with
not one scintilla more of demonstration, and in accepting
it proposed for itself the unwelcome task of
convincing the English people that they should
evacuate their country.</p>

<p>It would be hard to conceive of anything to the
English mind less conceivable than such a desertion.
Its mere mention raised the most violent denunciation
and poured a torrent of abuse upon the
unfortunate advisors. The thought of it sapped
the very foundations of the English sense of existence.
It seemed the vertigo of madness. It deranged
the most obvious assertions of common
sense. It was an impeachment of the English reality.
To think of it was a betrayal of trust, a breach
of faith, a succinct defiance of the Almighty, a
blasphemous rejection of the lessons of history, a
timorous surrender to the threats of the weather.</p>

<p>But later, when the Scottish population began to
throw its inundating tides of people into England,
and the Englishman read at his breakfast table of
the floes of ice in the Clyde, and the buried Grampians,
the insurmountable drifts about Stirling, and
the incipient neve masses on Scuir-na-Gillean, in
Skye, the reluctant embarkation of the merchants
of Aberdeen, the closing of its great University, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
shrinkage of business in Glasgow; when they realized
that in truth the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
had become united by a broad gateway through
which the Gulf Stream, which erstwhile transported
the heat of the equator to Europe, now emptied its
torrid waters, bathing the western coasts of North
America as far north as Alaska, and bringing to
that Arctic country almost the same blessing of
fructifying warmth with which it had before endowed
England; when still further they began to
hear, and to realize, by private letters, the affectionate
summons and offers of the colonies, the
overwhelming loyalty of the brothers across the
sea, their frenzied eagerness to place their lands
almost gratuitously in the hands of the mother people,
and assume towards them the role of honored
beneficiaries, then a strange, unwonted wondering
began, as to whether it might not be best to look
into the matter. And then intelligence aroused,
with continued inspection, the impression grew,
that indeed the prospects were alarming. The English
mind, once startled in a certain direction, soon
takes on an impetus proportionate to the inertia of
its first movements, and therefore by a natural law
of psychology and mechanics gains in accelerated
velocity with each succeeding moment. So it was
now. The industry of the scientific propaganda, its
inventive persistency, was followed by the conversion
of the large financial and commercial interests,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
and then a panic seized the great masses of the
nation. Parliament took it up, the papers bulged
and teemed with information, discussion, advice,
and reports. A determining influence with the
large trading classes was the decline, in some instances
the positive disappearance of business,
while to others not chained in insular possessions,
a new world of adventure and chance seemed not
altogether undesirable.</p>

<p>The pressure of popular approval hastened, in
the Parliament, the formulation of a plan for the
slow and careful removal of the population. The
Law of Exodus, as it was termed, was a thoroughly
English legislative work. And that meant a wise,
adequate and deliberate evacuation. It involved a
re-tabulation, so to speak, of the wealth and occupations
of the individuals of the country, and so adjusted
their departure, their association, their duties,
their facilities and trades, that the least competition
would arise in the new quarters, and then
they were also so distributed in the colonies, that
they met the requirements of these, as it was ascertained,
from the authorities, the latter demanded.
Thousands upon thousands had already sailed
away, forming for themselves combinations as their
acquaintances and connexions permitted, and still
other thousands, with property invested abroad
made a home in the land in which their support
lay. A singular consequence of the situation was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
the speculative gale it produced in America, where
large amounts of unemployed or released capital
took flight. It settled tumultuously in Wall Street,
voraciously attacking every variety of security,
and driving stock values out of sight in a tremendous
boom that disconcerted the tried veterans of
the famous mart.</p>

<p>All the time the Londoner was himself gaining
some convincing insight into the dread nature of
the climatic change about him. The snows covered
the greater part of the streets of London, the parks
became desolate tracts, deserted, uncleared, unused,
swept over by the freezing winds, and chased
from end to end with buffeted wreaths of snow,
whose ghostly swirling columns ran over the wintry
exposures like a race of Titanic spirits, crossing
each other in cyclonic confusion, or meeting in shivering
collisions, dissolving in cloud-bursts of microscopic
and penetrating needles of ice. The
Thames was almost closed, the shipping stayed idle
at the wharfs, almost unmitigated suffering spread
among the poor, for miles the streets were only traversed
by foot-paths worn by their occupants, and
the strangest sights occurred in the smaller reservations
like Lincoln Inn Fields, St. Paul’s Churchyard,
the Temple Gardens, the Artillery Grounds,
Finsbury Circus and other confined spaces. By a
freak of circumstances, and the curious and entirely
unexpected vagary of the winds, the snow piled up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
and up in these quarters, because of a peculiar inrush
of wind from the converging streets around,
and this sweeping effect continued until the mound
of snow, circumvallating the buildings, reached to
their windows or overtopped them, while in enclosures
not pre-empted by buildings, as Highbury
Fields, and the various cemeteries, the hills of snow
formed colossal billows, which seemed like a phalanx
of rigid waves tortured into fantastic pinnacles
by the storms of wind. Such spectacles turned
back the life-blood of the bravest, and converted
the most recalcitrant objectors to the new view of
the necessity of leaving the immemorial splendors
of England’s Capital.</p>

<p>It was a demoralizing and distressing picture of
change, to visit the great docks on the Thames; the
London docks, the Commercial and the West India
docks, and in the place of the varied throngs, the
miscellaneous rabble of laborers in which the forms,
faces and even the dresses of the people of the
world made a composite aggregate, which was a
suggested reflex of the myriad-handed toil and industry
of London, a significant hint of the immense
wealth and opulent indulgence of the great metropolis—in
place of all this, the harsh winds whistled
over deserted yards, shrieked through the rigging
of idle ships, or blew tempestuous volleys of rime
and sleet across the river between Wapping and
Rotherhithe. Before this awful change, English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
fortitude and confidence quailed, or wrapping itself
in the reserve of bitterness and distrust, turned
silently away, for an instant, at least, driven to confess
that the time-honored legend of English destiny
had become a perverted and silly shibboleth.</p>

<p>February 12th, which has in meteorology, along
with the twelfths of November, May and August,
been isolated as the period of the ice saints, viz.:
four periods characterized in an unaccountable
manner by a fall in temperature—this 12th of February,
1910, had been determined by the Parliament
for the closing of the great debate on the Motion of
Evacuation. It was this night that Leacraft and
Thomsen found so clear and cold, a keen and perilous
intensity of cold probably never before experienced
in the English islands, unless one, in his inenviable
task of comparison could have found an
equivalent in the Ice Age itself.</p>

<p>When Leacraft and his companion attained the
Victoria Tower, already the debate, on the motion
which in an enlarged way had been before the English
nation for more than a month, had reached its
final stage. Balfour had been chosen to close, in
a long peroration, the tremendous forensic display
which had been limited to the walls of the Houses of
Parliament. But it was only an episodic and distinguished
incident in an argument which had convulsed
every household in England, which had sent
its clamorous assertions and appeals to the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
English-speaking people throughout the world, and
which would, by all rational expectations, remain to
the end of historic time the most startling venture
in language, the most dramatic performance in oratory
ever known.</p>

<p>The two men hurried in, past the flaming chandeliers
of the beautiful archway. Upon Leacraft
showing his particular cards of admission, an attendant
escorted them through the Royal Gallery,
the House of Peers, the Peers’ Lobby, all of which
were deserted. They chased in most indecorous
fashion through the marvellous rooms, only intent
upon catching the last words of the great speech
whose purport and end was to empty those glorious
apartments of their human interest, and bring expatriation
upon all the memories they harbored.
They passed through the Central Hall, the Commons’
Lobby, the Division Lobby, and were expeditiously
inserted in the Reporters’ Gallery, where,
backed up against the topmost wall, they surveyed
the thronged mass beneath them. Every inch of
space, every point of observation was packed, and
the scene, on which a softened flood of light fell,
with an enhancing effect of wonder, was eloquent
in picturesque power and interest. Lords and
ladies—to-night no interfering screen concealed
the women—earls, dukes, baronets, the clergy, even
bishops in their robes, merchants, men of science,
bankers, and the whole House of Peers, standing at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
the bar of the House of Commons, were arrayed in
a vast and irrelevant assemblage, pierced by one
thought, the anguish of a supreme decision. And
Balfour!</p>

<p>Upon an erect and stalwart figure, moved by an
instinct of regnancy at this sublime instant to stand
free of his compeers in the broad way, between the
benches of the Government and those of the Opposition,
and facing the speaker—all the eyes of that
assemblage were riveted. The classic sentences of
Macaulay in describing the trial of Warren Hastings—hackneyed
as they are by innumerable repetitions—might
well apply to this unwonted and intense
spectacle; “the long galleries were crowded
by an audience such as has rarely excited the fears
or the emulations of an orator. There were gathered
together from all parts of a great, free,
enlightened and prosperous empire, grace and female
loveliness and learning, the representatives of
every science and every art.” And the comparison
can be illuminatively emphasized. At the trial of
the illustrious Pro-consul, curiosity in a man, sympathy
with a race, admiration for the local splendor
of a gorgeous scene, summoned to the hall of
William Rufus the resplendent galaxy. But the
motives were objective. In the present case, thought
Leacraft, how pathetic, how tragic their subjective
force. It was as if the children of a home, about to
disappear in some horrible engulfment, calmly prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
to leave its threshold, but it was that sorrow
multiplied by all the individuals of a nation, and
magnified by the moral surrender of the associations
of two thousand years. A nervous tension,
that was expressed in the almost petrified stare of
some faces, the startling pallor of others, the half-open
lips, the strained attitudes, the involuntary
shudders, the curious grieved looks of inattention,
overmastered the assembly. Its contagious thrill
seized Leacraft, and brought his mental receptivity
up to a quickened pitch of almost deranged alertness,
while every sense seemed preternaturally
awake.</p>

<p>He heard a woman sob somewhere in front of
him, and far down the left gallery, in the glare and
glitter, he saw a noble head, white-haired, but still
wearing the flush of manhood’s prime upon his
cheeks, leaning on a hand, and turned towards him,
with unchecked tears coursing silently from its
upraised eyes; he saw a little girl clasping the neck
of her mother and father, as she sat half on the laps
of each, and heard the soft lisp of her kisses on
their brows; he saw the almost saturnine face of a
dowager stonily gazing at the speaker, and, most
strangely, he detected on her finger a topaz ring cut
in <em>relievo</em> with the head of Queen Victoria; and
yet, while his senses reported these trifles with
startling keenness, they were also all enlisted in
catching every gesture, every movement, every accent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
of the man whose plastic power of eloquence
was there engaged in pleading for English abdication.</p>

<p>How the words rang in his ears, how persuasively
the voice sank and rose, and with what a
soaring melody some of the cadences seemed to
linger in the scented air. “Let us,” it said, “bow
before the revelation of our own destiny. The
ordination of Nature is the express reflection—nay,
it is the objective expression of Divine will. Accept
it with submission, with the subserviency of
faith, and act on that condition with the abundance
of that native resolution that from the time of Alfred
has made our path upward, outward, onward.</p>

<p>“I do not, sir, under-estimate the tremendous ordeal;
I cannot be blind to the colossal undertaking.
It resumes in one herculean exertion, all the efforts
of our race through two thousand years. It is
without precedent, or else it shall only be reverently
compared to the exodus of the Children of God
from Egypt. And in that light, sir, without subterfuge
or apology, without extenuation of rhetoric,
without ribaldry or vanity, I do regard it. We are
solemnized by some vast scheme in the order of
things to carry with us the genius of our civilization
to another home, where its power and beauty
shall both benefit others, and become themselves
more powerful and more beautiful. We have lived
through a stadium of progress and achievement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
We certainly advance to the opening of another.
Let the gathered multitudes of our race, here at
its ancestral hearth, gird up their loins and accept
the august command to go forth.</p>

<p>“From the Witan of the Angles and the Saxons,
through a feudal hierarchy to Magna Charta,
through the provisions of Oxford, the Model Parliament
of Edward I., by the rise in political privileges
by the Towns, by Merchant gild and Craft
gild, by the Good Parliament of 1376, by the relentless
rebukes of Richard in the Merciless Parliament,
by reason of popular censure and the eloquence
of common men as with John Ball and the
revolts of 1380, in the insurrection of Wat Tyler—followed
as it was by shameless, mad ventures—through
Wickliff, by the glories of the Tudors, the
overthrow of the Stuarts, by Pym, Hampden,
Cromwell, by William of Orange, by parliamentary
reform and legislative extension—from the
first glimmerings of civic life, to the light of the
modern day, this nation has grown in strength, in
reason, in the deliberate purpose of holding even
the scales of Justice.</p>

<p>“But, sir, with new positions, new prospects, new
opportunities in illimitable areas of expansion, we
enter upon undreamed of material enlargements.
A greater London will, in the coming centuries appear,
in which through the phase of exaltation we
shall assume, will be seen the Miracle of Time, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
which all we have learned, the highest technical
skill, our loftiest constructive, creative mind will be
realized.</p>

<p>“The social power, the redemptive agencies, the
final product of his thought, aspirations, skill, will
be incorporated in this City of Man for men—the
City of the Future—and it will be ours—all ours—<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">London
rediviva, London redux, London sempieterna,
et ne plus ultra</i>. A greater England shall
be gathered within its walls. It will hold our sanctified
patriotism, our emancipated reason, our ennobled,
disciplined applied science, the embodyment
of our imagination, and to its doors the world
will gather, too, in fealty, in trust, in homage.</p>

<p>“‘O et praesidium et dulce decus meum.’”</p>

<p>The voice ceased, the speaker dropped dumbly
into his seat, and for an instant, held his hands over
features convulsed with feeling. The surprising
thing then was—the awful silence, the deadness of
that living, throbbing, almost frantic audience, who
looking out upon a blackness of uncertainty felt the
happy past, radiant with ease and fame, ceremonial
and cultured luxury, slipping out of their possession
forever, and uttered no sound.</p>

<p>The Speaker of the House rose; there was a
shifting of heads, the rustle of turning bodies, a
simultaneous orientation, but no other sound, and
Leacraft scanned the multitude more. Again the
portentous silence; the Speaker with quite unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
ardor alluded to the imposing power and beauty of
the speech, and put the motion.</p>

<p>And then another thing more astonishing happened,
that House of Commons leaped to its feet
and shouted in one long, vibrant roar, “Aye! Aye!
Aye!” The eager agony of the assemblage then
split and tore the proud repression that had almost
strangled it. Cry upon cry started from various
points, and the clamor grew, the agitation took on
the aspect of disorder and panic, and then it resolved
itself into thundering cheers for the King, and
then, with electrifying unanimity the multitude
sang the national anthem.</p>

<p>It was over. The House of Commons had ordered
the evacuation of England; the House of Peers
would follow their lead, and while that evacuation
would take place slowly, covering a long space of
time, and permit the recreant forces of nature to
reform—if they would—the face of the world as
it had been, while it had consideration for all the
conflicting interests involved, and was so skillfully
framed as to cause the least shock of derangement
to the immense business agencies, still it was a
surrender of the proudest people on the face of the
earth to the blind powers of nature, and it meant
for Englishmen a new heaven and a new earth.</p>

<p>Leacraft and Thomsen returned that night to
their lodgings at the Bothwell Club, through Pall
Mall, where but a few of the clubs were still in action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
and as they moved painfully along over the
debris and dirt, the disturbed and shapeless heaps
of snow, the abandoned articles of furniture, in
front of some houses, and saw the darkened fronts
of others, with broken windows, and broached and
falling doors, noted the signs of interior commotion
in the treasury, the admiralty, the foreign and Indian
offices, the war office and the horse guards,
they felt that Parliament had already been forestalled,
and that the evacuation of London and with
it all England had already begun.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE EVACUATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Events were moving rapidly. Ever since the
Parliament, by a legislative decree, had authorized
the desertion of England, and the eventful day approached
when the King and his household, the
Parliament itself, and the Church and the Titled
Estate should, in a formal and expressive manner,
leave England’s shores, the mass of the population
had been diligently hunting about for refuge and
occupation. Steamers and ships had scattered in
all directions the fleeing multitudes. Relatives
abroad, friends and even acquaintances offered
homes and employment, no utility now was too
small to be considered, nor any designation too insignificant
to merit attention. This scampering
was largely among those who felt the pinch already
of idleness and the diminishing chance of work,
among operatives and workmen, clerks and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
bread winners of the middle class. The nobleman
and the pauper did not stir.</p>

<p>The English nation had decreed through its legislature,
that the evacuation of the country should
be conducted with pageantry, that the solemn parting
should be enrolled in all time honored ceremony
and stately pomp with which kings had been crowned,
and for which, with all its heart and mind, the
English nature cries out with unappeasible hunger.
So the moment for the King’s departure, which
meant the official desertion of the Old Home,
might be justly compared to the flight of the queen
bee in the bee colony when her faithful followers
swarm after and upon her, and with resolute constancy
create a new city about her inviolable person.</p>

<p>The King was to leave England in June, 1910,
and when he left with sumptuous and melancholy
observance, with splendor of color and depth and
power of music, with uniform and ritual, with
prayer and chorus and prophecy, with august and
intolerable grandeur, with the art of tradition and
the ornaments of invention, he was to pass down
to Tilbury and sail away beyond Gravesend to the
new realm of his possession on the shores of Australia.
It was a pretty hard thing to believe; it was
a harder thing to do.</p>

<p>But it was to be done with all the gorgeous effectiveness
which accumulated traditions of centuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
and the practice of every day and the mere resources
in artifices and equipment of a magnificent
realm could display. The day came with splendid
beauty, the sun shone over an England which somewhat
returned to the flowery loveliness of its olden
sweet estate. The city had been cleared, though the
snowfalls had reached the most unexpected depth,
and the severity of the winter had been appalling.
The meteorologists discovered the fact that the
western and northwestern zones of extreme precipitation,
those of eighty inches had moved inward,
and had even exceeded this maximum, and the condition
of the country was really extraordinary and
desperate. The immense accumulations of snow in
the outlying districts had risen to such heights that
the low, long houses of the peasantry were covered
and the aspect of the country was that of a Labrador
landscape transplanted to southern latitudes,
where trees, stone walls and villages assumed the
place of the more familiar tundra, plains and stone
floored plains. Suffering had been very general,
and the importunity of nature had done more to
convince the people that the necessity of removal
was an actual threat, not to be avoided or placated,
than the speeches, the tracts of the scientific societies,
or the deliberations of statesmen and editors.</p>

<p>But in London, on this twentieth of June, though
the air bore the strange traces of the changed climate,
in its tingling sharpness, yet this exhilaration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
only served the purpose of adding swiftness
to the movement of the hosts of people in the
streets, and a new and wonderful tremor of excitement
to their eagerness in awaiting the development
of the day’s great preparations.</p>

<p>In the morning the King was to be enthroned in
Westminster Abbey, and to receive the homage of
the Peers, and, as usual at a coronation, the day
itself was inaugurated with the firing of a royal
salute at sunrise. A measure of the august and
overpowering rites and observances that mark the
assumption of a King’s rule was now to be gone
through with, as a symbol and memento, before the
King transferred his throne to another land; and
this ceremonial was emblematic of the unbroken allegiance
of the English nation to his removed majesty.</p>

<p>The King was to ascend the theatre of the Abbey,
and be lifted into His Throne by the Archbishops
and Bishops, and other Peers of the kingdom, and
being enthronized, or placed therein, all the great
officers, those that bear the swords and sceptres,
and the rest of the nobles, should stand round about
the steps of the throne, and the Archbishop standing
before the King should say the exhortation, beginning
with the words, “Stand firm, and hold fast
from henceforth the Seat of State of Royal and Imperial
Dignity, which is this day delivered unto you
in the Name and by the Authority of Almighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
God, and by the hands of Us, the Bishops and Servants
of God, though unworthy, etc, etc.”</p>

<p>And then the homage being offered and accepted,
the King attended and accompanied, the four
swords—being the sword of Mercy, the sword of
Justice to the Spirituality, the sword of Justice to
the Temporality, and the sword of State—were to
be carried before him. He should then descend
from his throne crowned, and, carrying his Sceptre
and Rod in his hands, should go into the area
eastward of the theatre, and pass on through the
door on the south side of the altar into King Edward’s
Chapel, the organ and other instruments all
the while playing.</p>

<p>The King should then, standing before the altar,
deliver the Sceptre with the Dove to the Archbishop,
who would lay it upon the altar there. The
King would then be disrobed of his imperial mantle,
and be arrayed in his royal robe of purple velvet,
by the Lord Great Chamberlain.</p>

<p>The Archbishop should then place the orb in his
majesty’s left hand. Then his majesty should
proceed through the choir to the west door of the
Abbey, in the same manner as he came, wearing
his crown and bearing in his right hand the Sceptre,
with the Cross, and in his left the orb; all Peers
wearing their coronets, and the Archbishops and
Bishops their caps.</p>

<p>The interior arrangements in the Abbey were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
familiar. From the west door where the procession
should enter to the screen which divides choir from
nave, two rows of galleries were to be erected on
each side of the centre aisle—the one gallery level
with the vaultings, the other with the summit of the
western door. These galleries should have their
fronts fluted with crimson cloth richly draped at
the top, and decorated with broad golden fringe at
the bottom.</p>

<p>On the floor of the centre aisle a slightly raised
platform or carpeted way, should be laid down,
along which the King and Queen, in procession
should pass to the choir. This was to be matted over
and covered with crimson cloth. On the pavement
of the aisle bordering this carpeted way
should stand the soldiery as a fence against interference.</p>

<p>The theatre where the principal parts of the
ceremony were to be enacted lies immediately under
the central tower of the Abbey, and was a
square formed by the intersection of the choir and
the transcepts, extending nearly the whole breadth
of the choir. On this square a platform was to be
erected ascended by five steps. The summit of this
platform and also the highest step leading to it, was
to be covered with the richest cloth of gold. From
that step down to the flooring of the theatre, all was
covered with carpet of rich red or purple color bordered
with gold. In the centre of the theatre the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
sumptuously draped chair was to be placed for the
sovereign, in which he receives the homage of the
Peers.</p>

<p>This interior pomp and splendor escaped the observation
of Leacraft, though he was not unfamiliar
with the details of the solemn pageant, but now
it hardly interested him. His mind by a natural
emancipation from the thrall of such spectacles,
dwelt rather on the attitude of the people in this
extreme peril and solicitude. He felt inquisitive
to learn their feelings, their hopes, their cohesiveness
in the changed estate. Were they likely to resolve
into a chaos of preferences with only the cry
of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sauve qui peut</i> in their mouths, or would they
follow the new destinies, and preserve the nation.
At length the populace were coming into their
own. It was pretty evident that a King and Queen
and Regalia, and Peers, and Peeresses, and a much
surpliced Clergy, would not make a nation, without
the workers, the rent payers, the men of action, the
bread winners, the clerks, artisans, and merchants,
the householder and his family, and that the sacred
classes would be suddenly subjected to a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">reductio
ad absurdum</i>, if they formed the only inhabitants
of the new regime and their titles lost their
<em>raison d’etre</em> with the disappearance of the untitled
mass.</p>

<p>After the rendering of the Homage at the Abbey,
the Procession was to take place, and the King arriving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
at Tilbury, with the royal family, a selection
of the Peers, the highest Episcopal prelates, and
certain representative men from the Commons, including
the Ministry, would be received on the
Dreadnought, and with a glorious escort of the largest
battleships, carrying the royal equipage, the
furniture of Windsor Castle, and of St. James palace,
and of the Buckingham mansion, the archives
of the Parliament, at least a portion, steam away
from England to Australia, to Melbourne. This
Nucleus of Government holding the inseparable insignia,
and the actual essence of the English nation
would there, with pomp and solemn allegations,
with rolling music and pious prayers, with thunders
of the guns by the Navy, and the salute of the
Army, be as it were reinstalled.</p>

<p>But the route of the procession was not to be
straight out of London. It comprised a broader
purpose. It was proposed to circumvallate London,
to impregnate it with the sentiment of the King’s
leaving. It should be traversed and penetrated in
all directions, gathering thus the public allegiance,
and absorbing its loyalty, shedding the effulgence
of the royal splendor upon the populace, and enchaining
them anew to the principle and fact of
English Sovreignty. It was a stupendous project.
It involved stations and relays. Camps of the military
were to be established at St. James Park, at
Victoria Park, at Regent’s Park, at the West End<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
near Paddington, at Wormwood Scrubs, and in the
southern districts around Clapham Common and
towards Putney.</p>

<p>The King was to stop at resting places, and in the
largest local churches, a reduced form of the Homage
was to be instituted involving the <em>enthronization</em>,
with the displays of the Regalia, and the jubilation,
and the reverence of the people expressed,
as always in the <span class="locked">shouts—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">May the King live forever!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The bells of the churches were to ring, the houses
were to hang out their banners, flags were to cover
the streets, bands stationed on prominent balconies,
at points covering the entire long journey through
and around the city, were to play national airs, that
so there might be generated an overwhelming enthusiasm,
a tumult of devotion, and thus constrain
the Englishman afresh in the religion of the nation’s
immortality.</p>

<p>It was finely conceived, this elevation of the
King. It was gorgeously executed. The imagination
of the people was tremendously impressed,
and the Ark of the Covenant of the eternal supremacy
of the English crown seemed thus visibly incorporated,
and presented to them. The procession
was glittering, and it was majestic. It ponderously
emphasized the English idea. There were really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
two processions, the first from Westminster to
Buckingham Palace, the second through London.
In the first—the King issued from Westminster, his
crown borne before him, but holding in his right
hand the Sceptre with the Cross, and in his left the
Orb. Then began the most wonderful State ride
through London. The superb chariot of the King
surrounded by heralds, kings at arms, pursuivants,
with judges, councillors, lords, and dignitaries, was
followed by the open carriages of the nobility.</p>

<p>The King was immersed in color. Garter—principal
King-at-arms—was a miracle of dress.
He wore a frock or tabard, crimson and gold emblazoned
with the quarters of the United Kingdom.
Then there was the Clarencieux of the South, and
Norroy of the North—and the heralds of Lancaster,
Somerset, Richmond, all wonderfully bedight, and
the pursuivants—Rouge Croix, Rouge Dragon,
Portcullis, and Blue Mantel—looking like the
genii of a Christmas pantomime. And here with
the King were the Lord Chamberlain, the Lord
Steward, and the Master of the Horse. And there
followed this cavalcade, surrounding the King like
a many colored fringe, the carriages of the nobles
wherein all the signs of degree, order, rank, were
sumptuously shown. Here the robes of the Peers,
crimson velvet edged with miniver—the capes furred
with the same—and powdered with bars or
rows of ermine, according to degree, rolled together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
in a bank of oscillating glory. Beneath the
mantles a court dress, a uniform, or regimentals
were descried. The coronets were even worn, and
as the scintillating groups passed, eager admirers
separated the coronet of the baron with its six silver
equidistant balls, from the coronet of a viscount
with sixteen, from the coronet of an earl with
eight balls raised on points, and with glistening
gold strawberry leaves between the points, from
the coronet of a marquis with four gold strawberry
leaves alternating with four silver balls, and from
the coronet of a duke with the eight gold strawberry
leaves.</p>

<p>Nor did beauty hesitate to add its witchery to the
sports of splendor, and in behalf of that ancient
idea of Monarchy, which now was enlisted against
a deep peril of mistrust and repudiation. The
Peeresses formed part of the procession. Their
scarlet kirtles over the petticoats of white satin and
lace, their flowing sleeves slashed and furred, their
cushioned trains heaped in confusion in the carriages,
and relieved by shining plaques of silver
silk, were still more bewilderingly graced by jewelry,
by oceans of gems resplendently transfigured in
the blazing sun. In this momentous pageant the
limits of the spectacular were invaded, even distended,
in which some saw not only a lack of good
taste, but the pressure of a little fear.</p>

<p>Even the church advanced the bold bid for admiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
and wonder. It sent out its archbishops,
bishops, rectors, canons, prebendaries and deacons,
to compose parts of the vast exhibit to be interwoven
in the variegated human carpet that filled the
streets. Before the churches that were passed,
choirs gathered and sang melodiously; the strong
religious fibre of the English men and women was
sedulously appealed to, or else it was the elemental
flaming forward of their powerful conviction. At
this strange moment there was less of pretence and
trick than sincerity. The heart of the people was
steadfastly united with the old traditions; they
clung unbrokenly to the inheritance of English
greatness. There was no reason to doubt their
faith.</p>

<p>The route of the second marvellous procession
was from the Abbey through Bird Cage Walk past
Victoria monument to Procession road, to the
Strand, to Fleet street, over Ludgate hill, past St.
Paul’s, to Cheapside, to Bishops street, to Shoreditch,
to Hackney street, and so out to Victoria
Park and Homerton. Back again to Highbury
Fields, south by Essex road to Pentonville road, to
Euston road, to Marylebone road, through Regents
Park, through Hampstead road to Hampstead, to
West Side, through Edgeware road to Hyde Park,
and the Bays water to Holland park, to Hammersmith
road, by Hammersmith bridge road to Castelnau;
thence to Putney, to Battersea, to Clapham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
to Camberwell, thence to Walworth road, by London
road, by Waterloo road to Westminster
bridge, to the Houses of Parliament, and on the
banks of the river Thames to the Tower, and on
through White Chapel, Mile End road, Bow road,
to Bromley, to Stratford, to Barking, to Tilbury.</p>

<p>Nothing so prodigious had ever been conceived;
and the resources of the empire, of the military, and
the squadrons of the colonists, who should again,
as at the Jubilee of Queen Victoria, present the
diversified elements of English power, would be
involved.</p>

<p>At Tilbury on the Essex bank, opposite Gravesend,
where rise the low bastions of Tilbury Fort,
originally constructed by Henry III, King Edward
the VII, would in a fashion diverse, and with a different
end in view, also declare that he “had the
heart and stomach of a King, and of a King of England
too,” as had said Queen Elizabeth. But now
it should be said by a King unappalled by the invasion
of the powers of the air, as she was before
the power of Spain, but now said with undiminished
confidence and high hope, though said too with
obedience to the supreme mandate of expulsion.</p>

<p>Before it took place, Leacraft and Thomsen began
their long walk from Ludgate hill, and Leacraft
intently watched the street crowds. He noted
also with recording interest the groups in the balconies
with lunch baskets. The expectant air everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
was not unnoticeably mingled with a kind
of frightened silence. There was not much noise,
no indiscriminate hubbub in the streets, and where
groups were encountered, hurrying to their destination,
they were quiet and restrained. Tension
was evident, a high strung expectancy verging with
impalpable approach upon tears, and the agony of
penitential promises. The fundamentally religious
optimism of the Englishman was confounded, and
his acceptance of invisible guidance made itself
seen in faces desolated by the grief of tears.</p>

<p>The preparations were remarkable and elaborate.
The windows were filled with chairs. Platforms
were erected, almost luxuriously draped with red
cloth and scarlet velvet, and surging crowds in
spots seemed to bely the significance of the portentous
moment. From time to time as the two observers
walked in the middle of the street, they
stopped reluctantly to notice signs of mourning.
These took on the form of trailing streamers of
crape, hung upon white cloth and their singularity
amid the almost bombastic surplusage of scarlet
dressings, awoke protest and resentment. At one
point there was a particularly conspicuous dismal
challenge to the susceptibilities of the spectators
in a balcony loaded with sombre trappings which
gained a startling prominence because of the patriotic
and cheerful decorations on either side of it.
Before this lugubrious appeal a small group of malcontents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
had gathered, and were indulging in incendiary
criticism.</p>

<p>“Hits no use turning a sour face to the thing.
What’s got to be, is got to be, and a little heart will
keep a sour stomach from making itself sick. Hi
say we’re hall in the same boat, and cheerfulness
makes pleasant company. Such a show as that
hought not to be tolerated, Hi say.” This belligerency
came from the thick lips of a red faced man,
who had his coat over his arm, and whose leathern
leggings, corduroy knee breeches, and flaming weskit
with a high collar strapped to his muscular neck
by a pea green scarf, betokened a representative of
the “fancy,” or an ostler turned out for a day’s
holiday.</p>

<p>“Indeed I think so,” squealed a thin, short man
with a red nose and a curious habit of wiping his
mouth with a yellow handkerchief. “It’s hard
enough for the sufferin’ masses to leave hearth,
home, and, I may say, family, not to be saddened
more’n than is natural with these funereal suggestions.”</p>

<p>“Well,” shouted a sturdy arrival on the other
limit of the circle; “Let’s tear them down. The
quickest way to cure trouble is to git rid of it. It’s
rotten insultin’ to stick those weeds under our
noses.” Under the influence of these defiant words
the knot of men moved towards the objectionable
drapery with evidently unfriendly intentions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
But they had not been unobserved from the
inside of the house on whose front these
sad reminders hung. A window shot up and
a tall slender woman advanced to the edge
of the balcony. She was dressed deeply
in black, her neck was surrounded by some white
crepe stuff, and the sentiment, as Howells has it,
of her dress was a pathetic suggestion of bereavement
and misfortune. Her hair, yet luxuriant, was
plentifully sprinkled with gray; her face had the
authorized look of nobility and distinction. She
was yet prepossessing, though the crowding years
had brought her past middle life. The distinctive
impression she made upon Leacraft, as he and
Thomsen, somewhat withdrawn, watched the denouement
of this street episode, was that of abiding
sorrow, patiently borne, and doubtless united in
her, with Christian resignation and unsullied piety.
A beautiful picture of the English woman, who
resolutely lives her earnest life of prayer and self-sacrifice,
holding intensely to her heart some fond
memory, wreathed in amaranth. And Leacraft, as
an Englishman, blessed Providence there were
such. The men on the street were a little abashed
by the pale face and lofty mien of the lady who had
recognized their purpose, and placed herself there
to thwart it.</p>

<p>She came forward and instantly spoke; her voice
was excessively clear, but an underlying mellowness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
imparted an extreme sweetness to its tones.</p>

<p>“My friends you wish these mourning signs taken
away. They offend you. But when you know
that they express to me the approaching loss of all
my friends, you will not, I think, feel so harshly
about them. The King, in a week, leaves the shores
of England—the evacuation of England begins to-day—and
with the King goes the great English nation
and this wonderful city with all its memories,
with its beauty, its historic power, its incessant interest,
our common home for all our lifetimes, will
dwindle and dwindle and disappear, lost in arctic
snows and ice, at least so they tell us.</p>

<p>“But I shall stay. In this house suffering has
come to me; it has never left <em>me</em>. I shall not leave
<em>it</em>. I mourn for those who in going away die to
English pride, to English love, to English devotion,
and”—she leaned out over the sullen men beneath
her—“and die to me. These black films are for
them.”</p>

<p>She stopped. The men, worried and puzzled and
surprised, looked a little sheepishly at each other.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said he of the hostler type, “my
leddy, no offense, seein’ how you feel about it. Hi
say—’ave your way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” squealed the preacher, “if the empty
badges of mournin’ give ennyone—ennyone—satisfaction,
why it’s not in reason to question their motives
in this excroociating moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>“Gad! the lady’s right,” shouted the former belligerent,
whose prompt hint had at first nearly precipitated
the riot, “She’s got the right ring—and
I’m damned if anyone teches the rags there I’ll bust
his cock-eyed head aff his shoulders.”</p>

<p>This vociferous statement produced a hubbub of
approval, and won many distinct admissions of entire
acquiescence—and with these reassuring murmurs
the lady retired, after telling her thanks, and
the gathering withdrew down the street.</p>

<p>Leacraft and Thomsen continued their way westward.
Before them suddenly, after a half-hour’s
sauntering, shone an avenue of military splendor.
They were in Charing Cross, having pushed down
the Strand, and they were on the south side of
Trafalgar Square, and not far from the equestrian
statue of Charles I. Trafalgar Square was filled
with troops. The effect of color was transporting.
The massed regiments of infantry were broken by
parks of artillery, while immediately under Nelson’s
column the Nineteenth Hussars—the “Dumpies
of 1759,” the Fifteenth Hussars—“Elliott’s
Light Horse,” the Sixteenth Lancers—“the
Queen’s,” and the Thirteenth Hussars—“the ragged
brigade”—were confusedly stationed, their
mingling busbies and dependent bags looking like
a garden patch.</p>

<p>From point to point issued galloping videttes,
carrying their pennants on lance-heads affixed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
the stirrups, which undulated in the air, as the
horses pranced and caracolled. The tramp of
troops, the sighing of bugles, and the resounding
surges of music, surrounded them. It was afternoon.
The beginning of the first day’s procession
from the Abbey doubtless was at hand. The stirring
air communicated the thrills of an immense
event, and the people, petrified into attention, stood
crushed against each other in rows of forlorn expectancy.
The suffocating excitement was unbearable,
the more so because of its immobility. Leacraft
decided to rush through London, and reach
Victoria Park, the Hackney Marshes and Clapton,
in order to determine the attitude, the action, of the
poorer classes. Thomsen was unwilling to desert
the fermenting throngs around Trafalgar Square,
or miss, for a moment, the kaleidoscope of changing
soldiery, and so Leacraft, leaving him, entered
a hansom and shot off.</p>

<p>He was not averse to this solitude. His affections
for Miss Tobit had lately warmed into a
less indifferent kindliness, and he began to feel a
gnawing anxiety lest the pretty Scotch woman
thought less of him—in the way lovers like—than
she did of her cousin, the handsome and obnoxiously
unconcerned Thomsen. Thomsen knew exactly
Leacraft’s feelings, and regarded them with unconcealed
forbearance, and—what was more provoking—with
a frank condescension of sympathy. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
yet the men had become good friends; they had
talked long and seriously, with all the elements of
critical guidance they could summon, about the
strange reversal or revolution in the nation’s affairs.
But at these moments they were in an impersonal
frame of contact, and the personal exigencies
which later crept between them, were all absent.
Leacraft’s intellectual weight easily made
itself felt in these discussions, and Thomsen, with
cordial alacrity, assumed the obedient position of
audience and pupil.</p>

<p>As Leacraft was driven eastward in the swinging
vehicle, he flung himself against its cushions, and
again thought of the monstrous and incredible metamorphosis
in the fortunes of his people. The vigorous
life of ten centuries, with all its memories,
the heaped up riches of its achievements, the splendid
literary legacy of the past, with its art, its lineaments
of beauty, its dusky shadows, the solicitous
charm of its contrasted periods of history, the deep
encrustation, nay, rather, the unfathomable deposits
of character, and accomplishment which
overlaid the Kingdom of England, and, in this city
of London, the beating heart of its vast interests,
thickly choked each avenue and current of its life—to
abandon all this at the summons of a temperatural
caprice, at the tempestuous whim of an earthquake,
before the blind violence of frost and snow
and ice, was the most unendurable of humiliations!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
It bit too deeply at the generalized assumption of
the whole world, that man ruled the earth; it
soured the contentment of his avid vanity, and to
the Englishman it assailed the hitherto impregnable
fortress of his heroic conceit. And yet—the old
dream of a greater England arose, as it had arisen
a hundred times before, in all these troubling and
disconcerting months—an England leaping forward,
as an exultant youth, bearing in his hands
the trophies of new and brighter conquests, flushed
under changed environments, with the inspiration
of new ambitions, and new powers of creation,
issuing into a greater chapter of human growth
than had ever before been conceived or written.</p>

<p>And yet what an eviction! This glorious old
England, with its sweet homes, its innumerable
beauties, its convincing happiness of downs and
glade and gardens, flowering into clouds of blossoms,
its lakes, its gentle streams, its æsthetic softness
and dimness, its manifold and opulent charm
of landscape, the hurrying and constant kisses of
its moist skies, in league with all the graces of the
seasons—to cast this aside, and begin again, elsewhere,
in regions drear and sterile of all these
things; ah! that was too hard! too hard! and, as
he had often done, Leacraft covered his face with
his hands and sobbed.</p>

<p>Amid these fluctuating thoughts and feelings, the
hansom swung with vehement oscillations along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
the streets, in the more deserted parts of London,
and brought its occupant in sight of the Bethnal
Green Museum, from which a diversion along Old
Ford Road and Approach Road, flung him into
Victoria Park, the huge playground of the poorer
eastern section of the city. He was driven to the
eastern part of the immense reservation, and was
gratified to find a public meeting in progress, the
exact thing he most wished to be present at, and
to estimate.</p>

<p>In a broad and treeless area of the park, with
the grass showing hesitatingly after the long winter,
but vivid also in spots, in the strong light of the
afternoon, with an atmosphere strangely variant
from the traditional, and, to Leacraft, much loved
velvety softness and mellowed obscuration of former
days, were gathered a multitude of people.
They surrounded a speaker, who, on some sort of
improvised platform, with a knot of associated
leaders, with a swaying body and occasionally outstretched
hands, was engaged in a harangue which
was received with attention unattended by the
slightest demonstration of assent or disapproval.
It looked from a short distance almost like a devotional
assembly, it seemed so reverently silent, and
as Leacraft approached, this impression was partially
at least verified, for the speaker’s hands
ceased their agitated appeal, the occasional higher
cries proceeding from his lips died away, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
song or hymn burst suddenly from the still motionless
multitude. It lasted for an instant, perhaps
a single verse, and as Leacraft drew near, another
man from the platform group stood up, and
stepped to the front of the small stand. At that
precise moment the cannonading, agreed upon as a
signal, announced the starting of the royal cortege,
and the sad beginning of the imperial evacuation of
England. It was heard with far away reverberations,
as it was repeated from other nearer points,
and this vagueness, by a congruity of effect with
the dull misery weighing on Leacraft’s heart, seemed
to give to it a deeper poignancy of grievous import.
It produced the impression of an irrevocable
doom. As the sounds were heard by the assembled
crowds, the speaker lifted his hand and raised his
face skyward, as if in supplication, the heads were
all uncovered by one spontaneous impulse, and,
caught in the same wave of feeling, Leacraft sought
the invocation of his own blessing on the King and
all he stood for.</p>

<p>The interrupted speaker began his address. The
man was a strong type. His face was somewhat
leisurely framed in short whiskers, confined to his
cheeks; his eyes were large, blue and unblinking,
with a resolute look in them that had the merit of
extorting, at least, a respectful recognition; his
complexion met all the requirements of the English
reputation for color, but it left no impression of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
having attained its superior brilliancy through less
innocent means than exercise and personal care.
His broad, high forehead—a little heightened in its
expansive effect through the faltering recession of
the iron grey hair that stood a little stiffly above it—rose
above the admirably firm nose, whose size
and contour formed to the reader of physiognomies
another compelling admonition to give its wearer
the rational allegiance of attention. The man’s
voice was musical, with a single intonation that imparted
to it much carrying power, and it yielded to
certain tendencies of relaxation in speaking that
gave it almost a feminine sweetness. Leacraft put
him down for a labor leader of a sort, character and
design belonging to the best elements of the current
labor thought and organization; a man of that
impressive stamp in modern adjustments of self-assertion,
of which John Burns was so extraordinary
an example.</p>

<p>He had begun his speech as Leacraft, with insistent
zeal, pushed his way deeply toward the centre
and margins nearer the stage, of the attentive
throng.</p>

<p>“My friends, we must think for ourselves. We
are not likely to have our thinking done for us to
the best advantage. Now there are some plain, undeniable
facts. They are the kind of facts which
cannot be hid under a bushel basket, nor, for that
matter, under a king’s crown. One of the most intelligible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
of these facts—and it is fundamental—is
that the number of individual heads apportioned to
the same number of paired legs make up the population,
and units of population make nations, and
nothing else can. An aggregate of gentlemen
dressed in wigs, or holding truncheons sticking out
of purple and gold-braided shawls never has, and,
from sheer destitution, never could make a nation.
By all the signs around us, and I am willing to
accept them without any question, this country of
ours is going to move; is about to begin housekeeping
somewhere else, and I think it is an imperative
necessity for the success of such a change that
everyone living now on this island and calling himself
an Englishman, must move also, and move to
the same place (Hear, Hear,). But that moving is
conditioned. It is indispensably necessary that we
proclaim that condition, and insist upon its acceptance.
We hold the situation in our own hands. We
control the key to the future, to make or mar, or
destroy the continuity of the English name. Why?
Because if to-morrow the English workingman refused
to follow the English flag to Australia, and
took his wisdom, his tools and his savings somewhere
else, that flag would lose twenty millions of
subjects, and would wave over a remnant that could
not ensure its protection or its support. (Hear,
Hear). But the condition?”</p>

<p>The speaker paused, sweeping his eyes over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
sea of upturned faces, as if he was hunting through
the chaotic assemblage for the disclosure of some
particular visage which, either as an ally or an
opponent, might receive the shock of his omnipotent
secret. Whether he discovered the facial invitation
or not, was not revealed in his subsequent
action. He wheeled sideways to the stiffened
line of men behind him—doubtless expectant and
impatient numbers in the afternoon’s programme—and
bringing his clenched right hand into the
hollowed palm of his left hand, shouted, and not
discordantly: “The condition is the abolition forever
of the Law of Entail that to-day makes us a
servile race.”</p>

<p>Again he paused, as if so ponderous a statement,
so fiercely declared, would elicit a demonstration—but
to Leacraft’s abounding wonder, not a sound
arose from the vast audience. Whether it was appalled,
or thrilled, interested, or pleased, or dumbfounded,
it gave no sign. Its immutable decree for
the speaker to go on was its very silence. No public
orator could conveniently, with respect to his own
sensitive needs for public encouragement, stop
there. But he had become cautious. He felt that
perchance his auditors yet held mental reservations
in favor of things as they were, as they wished them
to continue.</p>

<p>“I say, with all my heart and soul,” he went on,
“stay with the Flag, stay with the King, stay with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
our lords and ladies, but on one condition as freemen,
to whose keeping now in this hour of peril
they are wholly given. Into your hands the God
of Nations entrusts their fate, but that fate can
only be propitious as you are true to yourselves,
your children, and your children’s children.”</p>

<p>Then came the long delayed approval. A wave
of excited pleasure brushed across the crowds, and
the hand-clapping, begun in many separate centres,
ran together, and with shouts of acquiescence,
with cheers, with central and periphera, agitation,
the huge aggregate expressed its tumultuous
adhesion. Leacraft felt that the loyalty of
these people was not impaired, and that the logic
of events would still hold them united in a consentaneous
allegiance at least, to the idea of the
English nation, though it was pretty evident that
the democratic claims of a wider opportunity for
personal, for family promotion, leavened all their
feelings, and that in the new regime it might be
expected, that a great deal of the present relation
of the classes would be swept away, and that the
old time idolatry of degree, the mere flunkeyism
of homage to name and geneological prestige,
among the masses, had shrunken into nothingness.</p>

<p>The stage was again occupied by a speaker, who
was interested in very practical and urgent questions,
the <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> and <em>when</em>, the disposition
of the emigrants to the new country, and he revelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
in plans, provisions, details of occupancy, and
employment. He showed conclusively the power
and effectiveness of organization, and the surprising
accommodations that can be extracted from
the most forlorn prospects by a shrewd use of forethought
and combination. Funds had been
scraped together, settlements, as yet in the dream
stage of realization created, and a practical socialism
consummated in the confederation of a large
numbers in one common venture. This aspect of
the emigration was dwelt upon by the speaker with
some rigor. It was a surprise to Leacraft, and lent
a strange expression to the still irreconcilable
spectacle of Englishmen looking for a new home.</p>

<p>Leacraft soon tired of sums, schedules, names,
and lists, and wandered away over the park
through the scattered groups, many centred
around one of those popular tribunes, who, by
reason of a little more leisure, perhaps a little more
application, and always much more labial facility,
influence their class profoundly. The broad lawns
were filled with these improvised parliaments, in
which too banter, argument, retort, query, admonition
bore a part. The perplexing thing was the
average satisfaction shown by the people, a kind
of holiday anticipation, as if they were off for an
excursion. To them perhaps it seemed a new start
in life, with the ground less encumbered by rivals,
by restrictions, less shadowed by priority, and favors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
for a few, and by the intimidation of a necessary
subserviency. They almost seemed happy in
the thought of change. There was bitterness in
this, and yet to Leacraft with his undissembling
and emancipated mind it was understood. It meant
<em>chance</em> to these people—this removal; and to most
of them chance never came, never could come as
they were. And then to linger, was starvation,
loneliness, disuse, death. The business of the country
had enormously shrunken, its productive power
had been halved, commerce was drifting in
stronger and steadier currents elsewhere, and no
where so strongly as to Germany, while the over
mastering pre-eminence of America loomed up in
proportions that paralysed conjecture.</p>

<p>Pondering on all these things Leacraft, in his
absorbed way, stumbled over a little girl on the
edge of one of the shaded walks. He quickly
stooped and picked her up, and confronted the
young mother, already hastening to the rescue of
her child.</p>

<p>“I should have been more careful,” said the embarrassed
gentleman. “Well, indeed we have all
good reason to be thinking more than seeing, these
times,” said the smiling mother, “I wonder what
we’ll all be like this time, come twelve month.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say that we shall be doing much the
same thing that we do here, in a different place—and
then we shall be a year older;” the young woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
laughed, and attested a complete willingness to
talk more, as she raised the ruffled child from the
grass and moved nearer to Leacraft. Nor was
Leacraft indifferent. He felt nettled, and willful,
with a subconsciousness of disappointment and
fear. This human and healthy mother, with the
fresh guerdon of her blushing youth in her arms,
was a helpful companion, and then she carried the
solace of some new story, perhaps a new need, and
Leacraft was not averse to being sympathetic or
helpful.</p>

<p>“Willie, that’s my man, sir,” continued the girl,
“is right glad to get away. Last Candlemas his
mother died, and left Willie her savings, and that,
and what we have, will tide us to America, and
Willie he says that he can get a home, and have a
little land, and Willie will be better of his sickness.
He’s not here the day, because of his cough and the
fever that he has. Ah! sir, it makes me chill at my
heart to see him, and to think that we are going so
far,” and the sweet face looked piteously at Leacraft,
and the tears overran the sad gray eyes.
Leacraft saw it all; a consumptive father, poor, out
of work, staking everything now to reach that
bourne, where the hopeless of all nations saw the
welcome light of opportunity. As he thought of
this he saw how great this avulsion was, what a
tearing up of the roots of family and home life, and
how ruthlessly they were to be planted in all sorts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
of soils, under alien skies, with inauspicious hands
to tend and raise them. He turned to the young
mother, and said, “It won’t seem so far, if a face
from the old home greets you there. I shall be
there also, and I will not only be glad to see you,
but glad to help you, if you need it. Take this,” and
opening his card case, he wrote an address in New
York city. “If,” he continued, “you do not remain
in New York, this will always find me. Good
bye.” He extended his hand and shook with unaffected
warmth the hand of the young English
woman, to whom the future loomed up in misty and
insecure, perhaps menacing shadows. How merciful
is sympathy, with what a solacing hand it soothes
the “ruffled brow of care,” and how genially
it bids the springs of life still follow, and, for a
moment at least, flow too in the sunlight of affection.
The English woman seized Leacraft’s hand
and pressed it tightly, and her face looked into his
with almost an enamored thankfulness; she raised
the baby girl and held it close to Leacraft, and the
restrained Englishman kissed it with quaint shyness.
At the instant, all the shifting helplessness
about him moved him inexpressibly. Again they
shook hands and the Englishman betrayed into
emotional excess, walked rapidly away, reassuring
her at the last that he would indeed be soon in
America.</p>

<p>A few feet away a different encounter swept him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
into a contrasted realm of emotional excitement.
A rude brawling loafer, none too sober, and reckless
in oaths and obscenity, had seized the small flags of
two little boys—union jacks—and throwing them
down on the ground, with an outburst of profanity
trampled and defaced them. The Englishman inflamed
and ardent, holding a wounded heart, stood
stupified and insulted. The next instant and he had
snatched the flags from their degradation, and with
an instantaneous revulsion struck the culprit of
this outrage squarely in the face. The blow was
unmistakably adequate. The ruffian reeled and
fell and failed to regain his feet, before a shout of
applause greeted Leacraft and a concourse of men,
who had hastened to the spot on the outcry of the
children surrounded him with welcome salutation.</p>

<p>“A fine blow—well hit and straight as a gunshot
man! That was the right medicine for his
complaint. I’m thinking that a little water might
wash it down. I say, boys, let’s duck him, souse
him in the lake. A tubbing might clean his sassy
mouth, and a man is none too good to be rolled in
the mud himself, who treads on the English flag.”
The subject of this criticism was on his feet again
in rather a belligerent mood, blinking and rolling
his fists in a minatory fashion, and sputtering defiance,
and presenting a transient spectacle of inebriety
and coarseness that would have been ludicrous,
if the temper of the men behind the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
speaker had not seemed so hostile. Leacraft felt
that they would do some serious mischief to the
miserable delinquent, and he stepped in front of
them interposing his body between the foremost of
the ranks, and the, now somewhat intimidated
drunkard.</p>

<p>“I think my friends, that you should spare yourselves
the trouble to punish this miscreant just now.
Let him alone. Neither he or his kind are likely to
hurt our flag. He has learned his lesson. To-day
my friends it becomes us to command ourselves,
and hold ourselves above resentment. We are all
sad, our hearts are heavy, the old Manse is to be
left and new conquests across the waters made,
new homes. Ah! how large the vision grows.”
The men had enclosed Leacraft in a dense circle.
He saw that he had their attention, while the stumbling
object of their first anger effected a shuffling
retreat with ignominious haste. His ruse now was
to entirely capture their thoughts. “It is a vision
of a new England, one made so by our devotion,
the fixed quality of our patriotism, an undeviating
union among ourselves, and just pride in our history,
our race, our King. It may be a better England;
it can not be a more beautiful England. We
are deeply stricken. While we bow to this necessity,
let us make the grandest display of fortitude
of resource, of hope, of courage, of skill, of judgment,
ever known. In our disaster we shall again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
conquer the world and hold it submissive at our
feet.”</p>

<p>Leacraft had enough disengagement of thought
to half smile to himself at this grandiloquent pretense,
but he knew his audience. It was quite British,
embued with that cloutish conceit which all
popular masses in every successful nation instinctively
display. He had appealed to their conceit,
though not only to that, and they responded enthusiastically.
As he finished this mild buncombe, not
without some misgivings as to his own honesty, as
he intended at first to repair to the United States,
the men nearest to him grasped his hand, others
shouted approbation, and still others in silence
moved away shaking their heads. Leacraft talked
with the men about him. He found that they had
been assigned places in the scheme of emigration;
some were going to Australia, with a systematic
dispersion over the region, which most needed
their labor, others to New Zealand into socialistic
farming; others to the cape and Rhodesia and still
others to Canada; so that his exalted sentiment of
solidarity lost a little of its impressiveness. Leacraft
lingered a while longer, and as the day ended
in a refulgent sunset with church bells, near and
far ringing to the services, that now for a week
would be held at all hours, inaugurating an unbroken
intercession at the throne of grace for the guidance
and protection of the people, he left his cordial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
acquaintances and went westward.</p>

<p>He reached Park Lane near the Kensington Gardens,
Gloucester House, and the fountain of
Thornycroft, the region of Mayfair, the dazzling
centre, the illustrious apse of English social splendor,
where the inherited privileges of life were
not discordantly blended with the no less inherited
gifts of fortune; that spot in all London which to
relinquish, would seem to sound the depths of
national disgrace. The moon swam in the lucent
sky, the air was clear, but cold, and the familiar
ravishing softness of the June nights as London
knew them once, was gone; those illumined mists,
the dewyness that spread from the ground to the
enveloping air, and threw veil over veil of shimmering
opacity upon arch and tower, sward, tree,
bridge and storied palace, was all gone, too, and
the beautiful neighborhood, as Leacraft wandered
through it, from Cumberland Gate—where he saw
snow still resting in sheltered recesses—along Park
Lane to Hyde Park Corners, through Grosvenor
Place to Chapel street, to Belgrave Square, was
revealed in an aerial sincerity, that gave its splendor
an almost scintillant loveliness, and drove still
deeper into Leacraft’s heart the sense of a bewildering
bereavement.</p>

<p>The streets were filled with flying equipages, and
the mansions were ablaze, the sidewalks held few
pedestrians, and as Leacraft sorrowfully moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
through the stately purlieus, music swept out from
open windows or swinging doors. Often he paused
and watched the descending occupants of the carriages;
they were entrancing women and peerless
men, their laughter was silvery and undismayed,
unchecked by tears. Could it be possible that these
inner esoteric circles of London high life and unimaginable
wealth indulged in revelry; could not the
crash and fall of empires turn the votaries of gayety
to soberer thoughts, or stifle the intoxicating
voice of pleasure? Leacraft wondered, and the
weariness of a great suspense weighed him down;
the ingrained Puritanism of his nature raged
against this heartlessness, this indecent bravado,
a mockery of joy, where all should be shadowed
with the sighs of penitence and supplication.</p>

<p>Leacraft was bitterly offended at this apparent
heartlessness; it startled him beyond the limits of
endurance; he looked for some representative of
this foolish life, upon whom to turn with rebuke
and denunciation. Leacraft wandered on in a disconsolate
mood, and the growing indications, with
the falling night, that the fashionable world of London
was engaged, in a preconcerted way, to spend
the last hours of its metropolitan sojourn in a
spendthrift vortex of excitement and conviviality
moved him to muttered objurgations. He had
slipped past Hyde Park Corners, past the Apsley
House, and had glided with hastening steps, as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
passion of revolt, at this unseemly loss of self-respect,
rose to a towering indignation, into Grosvenor
Square. He stood facing the long facade,
where in repetitive elegance, with columned
porches and mansard roofs, and wall-like chimneys,
the mansions of the very rich, illumined at
all their windows, poured forth a torrent of light.
Aggrieved and stupefied, he shot into Berkley
Square, and still no interruption to the aspect of
mad revelry. Could it be a frenzied spasm of indulgence,
before separation forever from the bliss
of the West End, that terrestrial paradise of swelldom
and financial and social glory? He wondered.
And thus wondering, he came to Devonshire
House, fronting Piccadilly. The comfortable
home, with its small brick work, peeking chimney
pots, the low entablature and triple doors behind
the iron gateway, and the unbroken watch of the
woman-headed sphinxes, on either side of the elevated
escutcheon of the Kingdom, was there, encompassed
by its imprisoning walls—and here, too,
the effrontery of lavish gayety assaulted his eyes.
The gates were flung wide open, powdered footmen
were ranged before the doors, arriving and
departing carriages threaded Piccadilly with conscienceless
celerity, music uttered its delicious melodies,
and in them was no requiem note, no throb of
sorrow, and the guests crowding into its dazzling
halls seemed untouched by thoughts less careless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
than the joys of the fleeting moments, whose hurrying
steps were bringing the dawn of disaster to
England. Exasperated, Leacraft turned on his
heel in disgust, and was going towards Leicester
Square, when a sharp report somewhere on the
side of the Geological Museum, and ahead of his
position, startled him, and the next instant he saw
a carriage, with prancing steeds, plunging down
the street, the swaying figure of the driver denoting
his complete loss of control, while on one side
of the equipage, that side towards Leacraft, the
pale face of a gentleman was seen, and beside him
the distracted visage of an elderly lady. As the
carriage approached Leacraft, it crossed the street,
and the front wheels collided with the curbing.
This administered a slight detention, and the
struggling horses turned again to the opposite side
of the thoroughfare. Quick to see his advantage,
Leacraft sprang to the head of the nearer horse,
and exerting all his strength, which was not inconsiderable,
he succeeded in tripping the beast, and
as it fell the traces holding its companion broke,
and the freed creature raced away down the avenue.
The driver leaped to the sidewalk and held
the now imprisoned horse, which, starting to its
feet, stood trembling beside him, while Leacraft
hastened to the door of the vehicle to liberate its
occupants.</p>

<p>He had already been forstalled by the gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
himself, who pushed the door back as Leacraft
reached it and stepped to the walk, followed instantly
by the lady in much commotion and disorder.
Their agitation was short lived, and succumbed
to the exercise of their own self-control. It
was the gentleman who first spoke: “I am under
the deepest obligation to you, sir, for your quickness
and your courage. You may readily have
saved us from a miserable fate. And”—Leacraft
interrupted: “You were going to some <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rendezvous</i>
of pleasure; this, sir, in my opinion, on the eve of
the nation’s assassination deserved punishment.”
The speech was crude, rude perhaps, and the bitter
taunt smote the stranger like a physical blow.
He recoiled from it as if the sting of a cowhide
had crossed his face. His face itself was a study.
He stared at Leacraft, and as the latter met his
gaze unflinchingly the pale face, distinguished in
outline, feature, and expression, flushed to the temples,
while the eyes seated under bushy brows
gazed at Leacraft with a peculiar earnestness, not
relieved of the dangerous suggestion of a rising
passion. His companion understood his excitement,
she clutched his arm, and seemed to apprehend
a physical outbreak. Then the mouth opened,
and spoke, and the voice was unexpectedly calm,
and the utterances measured: “We are under deep
obligation to you sir, but it is difficult for me to
restrain myself before the false statements you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
have ventured to make. Can you explain this insult?”</p>

<p>He moved nearer to Leacraft who did not budge,
but inspired with an increasing vigor of disgust,
and eager to summarily remonstrate at the seeming
cruelty of the parade about him, its grotesque
wickedness, said: “I do not wish to take advantage
of the accidental relations which have thus
unexpectedly thrown us together. But surely it
is known among men, and known bitterly among
Englishmen that the shadows of an awful twilight
are falling about them, and the Nation’s Day is
closing. At such a crisis can it be possible for men
and women, calling themselves English, in whom
the memory of English fame and English glory,
is still a present pride, can it be possible that at
this moment they still consort for amusement, for
display, for the fugitive follies of mutual admiration?
This aristocracy is the head and forefront
of the nation, and it should now be bowed in penitence,
in supplication, in the agony of self inquiry,
and it stupifies me to find them gay, when the
heart of England is breaking with grief.”</p>

<p>A curious metamorphosis worked in the lineaments
of the gentleman he was addressing. The
hard lines relaxed, and a wistful smile, that drew
its occult meaning from the man’s interior sadness,
stole softly over his face. He put out his hand,
which Leacraft accepted, and he returned Leacraft’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
pressure. There was an instant’s silence,
and then the stranger spoke, still holding Leacraft’s
hand, and retaining his undeviating inspection
of Leacraft’s face, as if he would force upon
himself the recognition of a friend.</p>

<p>“These are just words, sir,” he began: “but
how much you misunderstand what is going on
here. This apparent revelry is an effort to keep
from swooning: it is the forced continuance of a
life familiar to us, when that life is to be crushed
into nothingness; it is the defiance of habit, the revolt
against extinction, the mortal protest against
the infamous tyranny of circumstances. It is a delirium
of indulgence, to forget what is coming upon
us; a moment’s arbitrary refusal to think of the
future, a dance, in whose whirl we shall remit the
impulses of suicide. It is unreasonable, but its
monstrous unreasonableness to you sir, measures
our appalling sense of the disaster we can not stop
to think of, measures the intensity of the recoil
from obliteration; like the dressed and garlanded
victim of an Aztec immolation we taste again the
festive sweets upon which perhaps our cloyed appetites
are no longer to feed. We are the sufferers
in this eviction; the greatest, the poor, the artisan,
laborer, the vast mediocrity lose something, but
it amounts to little more than the exchange of one
station here, for another of the same sort somewhere
else. In a material sense our loss is incalculable;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
half our riches disappears but with that
loss goes social prestige, title, and the moral consciousness
of elevation, the breath of our
nostrils. I, sir, am ——.” Leacraft did not
move; his astonishment was too sharply focussed
upon all the astounding previous confession.
“And,” continued the man, “the
ruin of worldly fortune seems small, after all, compared
with the sacrifice of that dignified and sheltered
life, which moved serenely, with every accompaniment
of joy, in these delightful abodes, and
under the protecting aegis of an inexpressible
separation from the rest of the world. But”—he
seemed to wish to justify himself, somehow, as
he noticed the still petrified stare of Leacraft—“we
have not been neglectful of the matters of adjustment.
Committees have been appointed, plans
laid, funds appropriated, agents despatched, for
the selection of our new homes, and though we take
our flight with lopped wings, our plumage may in
time resume its former beauty. Do not misunderstand
us because of these assemblies. We too carry
deeper than you the pain of an unutterable grief.”</p>

<p>He finished, and Leacraft drawn into a reverie
over the singular confession, which was anything
but reassuring, and partook, to his mind, of the dementia
of the foolish victim of a depraved habit,
was silent. He felt the imperious requirements of
speech, but he could say nothing. He felt pity, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
was not without sympathy, though perhaps in that
matter, a certain savor of self denying control, and
a practical judgment interfered with his approval
of the hyperbole of the speaker. And, almost
dreaming, he stood there while the stranger and his
lady re-entered their carriage, to which the runaway
horse had been reattached, and drove off.
Leacraft watched them mechanically and then turned,
walked down Piccadilly, crossed Green Park,
and looked at Buckingham Palace. The huge
structure was partially illuminated, and the square
in front of it was filled with soldiers, many of
whom were at rest around the Victoria Memorial.
To an officer lounging near by, Leacraft said,
“Can you tell me where the King is to-night?”</p>

<p>“He sleeps at St. Leonards in Shoreditch,” was
the laconic reply.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE SPECTACLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was two days later than the events narrated
above, that Leacraft and Thomsen, with Miss Tobit
between them, sat in a crowded window on Hammersmith
road watching for the enormous procession
that had been slowly winding through London,
with offices and services, halts and functions,
as the King sadly led the departure of the English
people from the Mother of Nations.</p>

<p>And the vast pageant approached. Down Kensington
road its first glittering sallies were seen,
the block of London police, a gorgeous cavalcade
behind them of the peers of the realm, and in the
immeasurable distance the shimmering parts, that
looked stationary, and yet were coming on with
ample speed. The blaring trumpets in the bands
drew near, the street was cleared from curb to
curb, the dense assemblage, covering stoop and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
roof, and leaning from every window became silent,
the reiterated thud of the falling feet was
heard, and in an instant the marching host was
passing beneath them. The police and the peers of
the realm passed in silence or with barely noticeable
tokens of recognition. The peers presented
a dazzling array, on superbly caparisoned horses,
and in the regalia of their separate stations, with a
bearing of unmistakable dignity, and possessing in
a large measure the impress and gift of English
manly beauty, they uttered the note of <em>caste</em>. Behind
them came the marshalled Church, a wonderful
picture; choirs of boys, surpliced and gowned,
in open carriages, priests and bishops, in their
robes of office, with flying standards of chapel,
church or cathedral, golden lambs, crosses and
crowns, figures and mottes on white silk or ruby
silk, in wavering confusion, while hymns in wavering
sopranos rose petulantly, or again with sustained
vitality and strength. It appealed to the
people strangely. They became very still, and
faces contorted with sobs, or heads bowed to hide
the unbidden tears for a few moments drew a veil
of gloom over the splendid show. After the Church
and the peers, a forest of equipages brought in
view the marvellous display of the robed and
crowned peeresses, and succeeding this shining
cloud of matrons, that gave the touch of tenderness,
the atmosphere of feminine companionship, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
endurance, as if the mothers of England responded
in this untoward hour with an embracing sympathy;
after them came the King’s Household and
the King, with outriders, equerries, and panoplied
footmen, a miracle of ostentatious and ceremonial
color. His equipage was drawn by ten jet black
stallions, with diapers of the King’s colors on
their backs, and a line of ancient guardsmen, with
pikes in their hands, hedging them in, and a footman
in sparkling white at the head of each horse.
The King was himself robed in the gowns of his
high estate, and was uncovered, the Crown resting
on a cushion in front of him. A cheer rent the air,
unfurled flags and fluttering handkerchiefs, turned
a sea of faces into an ocean of white and red pennants.
The King gravely acknowledged the salute
and bowed to right and left. He was alone; the
Queen had been enthroned among the peeresses.
After the King came the Mayor of London, with
all the antiquated grandeur of his office, coach, beef
eaters, and all, and the people settled back again
to their luncheons, which had been interrupted by
the King.</p>

<p>Then came the troops. The display was exhaustive.
It was conceived upon a scale of imperial
magnificence, and it appealed in the succession of
its gorgeous units to the historic sense, to that divine
purpose of continuity which every Englishman
instinctively appropriates to his race and nation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
It represented the chronological development
of the English army. As its sonorous length
defiled before Leacraft, he saw an objective symbol—nay,
the corporeal fact—of England’s growing
power; regiment after regiment made a pictorial
calendar from 1660 to 1900, and to the informed
mind what a vista of martial glory, what a presentation
of advance and retreat over the tractless
wastes of the world, they made! It was a trampling
chronicle of woe and fame, shame and satisfaction;
it embodied the progress of ideas, the
clash of political tendencies, the spreading domination
of English rule; it was a panorama of battles,
the tide of victory, the ebbing terrors of defeat;
it reflected the pages of political designs, political
subterfuge, political confusion; the music
that swelled from its ranks now sent the long waves
of its solemn processional melody through the
thrilled spectators, now in limpid folk-songs, quivered
delightfully in their ears, and now again summoned
them to their feet with the stately and pious
invocation of the nation’s hymn.</p>

<p>The scarlet uniforms of the First Life Guards
passed, and Maestricht, Boyne, the Peninsular, and
Waterloo, flashed in view—the regiment which was
raised in Holland by King Charles the Second, and
was composed of eighty gentlemen, whose sobriquet
of the “cheeses,” along with other Life Guards,
had been acquired from the contemptuous refusal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
of their veterans to serve in them when remodelled,
because they were no longer composed of gentlemen,
but of cheesemongers.</p>

<p>Again, the Second Life Guards revived the
stained memory of the Stuarts, its own exile in the
Netherlands, its return with the restoration; and
its sea green facings pleasantly restored for a
moment the face of the injured Queen Caroline.
Here were the Royal Horse Guards, that inherited,
or at least might claim the virtues of the Parliamentary
army, which fought with dogmas at the
ends of their pike-staffs, and convictions in their
hearts. Now passed the First Dragoon Guards,
that carried on its proud records the Battle of the
Boyne in 1690, Oudenarde in 1708, Malplaquet in
1709, Fontenoy in 1745, Waterloo in 1815, and Pekin
in 1860, though to Leacraft’s sensitive mind
the last was an inscription of disgrace. The beating
hoofs of the “Queen’s Bays,” the Second Dragoon
Guards, hurried the reminiscent admirer back
to Lucknow and the Indian Mutiny. The nodding
plumes of the Prince of Wales, with the Rising
Sun, and the Red Dragon which came in view with
the Third Dragoon Guards, unfailingly recalled to
the custodians of English military renown, that the
regiment captured the standard and kettle drums
of the Bavarian Guards at the Battle of Ramilies.
Trampling on the heels of their horses, the lordly
“Blue Horse” defiled past, and the Fifth Dragoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
Guards, which supported the vital legend, “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vestigia
nulla retrorsum</i>,” and which captured four
standards at the Battle of Blenheim. Still the endless
lines advanced, wavered, stood still, and again
with rattling and shivering harness, passed. Now
it was the Second Dragoons, the Scotch Greys,
raised in Scotland, and older than any other dragoons
in the British army, that started the furious
applause, an ovation not unintelligently bestowed—for
it was they who captured the colors of the
French at Ramilies, and their standards at Dettingen.
Now it was the “Black Dragoons,” the
Sixth, on its glistening horses—once part of the
Inniskilling forces, and still bearing as its crest
the Castle of Inniskilling; now the Eighth Hussars,
whose Protestant fealty had made their
founders defenders of William of Orange at the
Battle of the Boyne, and who, with signal power,
captured forty-four stands of colors and seventy-two
guns at the Battle of Leswarree. Now the
Fifteenth Hussars, who bore upon their helmets
the dazzling inscription, “Five Battalions of
French defeated and taken by this Regiment, with
their Colors, and nine pieces of cannon, at Emsdorf,
16th of July, 1760.” Swelling hearts greeted
the Grenadier Guards, rich in the legacy of the
fame of the defeated French Imperial Guards.</p>

<p>Here were the Dublin Fusileers—the “Green
Linnets,” the “Die Hards”—the East Surries—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
West Yorks—and Devons, who had been part
of that indiscriminate blunder and glory—the Boer
War.</p>

<p>And now the infantry, in closing ranks, unrolled
the endless phalanxes. Where regiments, as entire
units, were absent, companies took their places, and
English cheers saluted the swinging standards.
The Thirty-fifth, which took the Royal Roussillon
French Grenadiers at the Battle of Quebec—the
Thirty-fourth, which impregnably covered the retreat
from Fontenoy—the Thirty-ninth, which defended
Gibraltar in 1780, and captured the insurgents’
guns and standards at Maharajpore, in 1843,
along with the Fortieth—the Forty-second, with
the red heckle in its bonnets, to commemorate its
capture of the French standards of the “Invincible
Legion,” in 1801, as well as for its distinguished
ardor in the Battle of Guildermalsen, in
1795, and the “Little Fighting Toms” stirred the
crowds, and even to those who regarded the pageant
with glances of bitterness, as the hollow mask
of a cruel abdication, even to their glassy stare, this
epic review brought a momentary gleam of gratitude
and pride.</p>

<p>Here was the Forty-sixth, whose colonel, with
the English nonchalence which always wins so enduring
a regard with Englishmen, in spite of a
kind of artifice of mere stubbornness in it, preached
a sermon to his men, under a heavy fire, about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Lacedemonians and their discipline—and which, at
least to an American, awoke only hateful memories—and
here the Fiftieth, “The Blind Half Hundred,”
who fought with damaged eyes in Egypt,
and who shone resplendent with courage and gallant
sacrifice at Vimiera—Ah! and here was the
Fifty-seventh—“the Die Hards”—which had thirty
bullets through the King’s colors, and only one
officer out of twenty-four, and one hundred and
sixty-eight men out of five hundred and eighty-four
left standing at Albuera. The people shouted and
stormed, an avalanche of flags suddenly sprang
up over the walled street, and at points showers of
flowers and bags of fruit descended in a tornado
of delight. Surely, if Englishmen had such blood
in them, the nation would yet live.</p>

<p>Here were the men from India, the regiments of
the Seventy-third, the Seventy-fourth, wearing the
badge of the “elephant,” the Seventy-sixth, too,
that unfurled its victorious pennants at the Battle
of Leswarree, and the Seventy-seventh and Seventy-eighth,
and on, on, straight in the line, brave
squadrons, whose illusive recognition in a numeral,
connoted glorious deeds, defiant strength, the prodigal
powers of the brave. The thundering salutations
drowned the rollicking music of “Clear the
Way,” the cry at Barrosso, which with fife and
drum announced the approach of the Eighty-seventh—the
Prince of Wales’ own Irish—and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
Eighty-eighth, the Connaught Rangers, whose more
loving sobriquet was “The Devil’s Own Connaught
Boys,” from its gallantry in action, and its irregularities
in quarters. Uniform and vanity with reciprocal
enhancement made the Argyleshire Highlanders
and the Gordon Highlanders and the
Sutherland Highlanders an envious spectacle to
manly youth, a vision of ingratiating heroes to
feminine beauty. Again India sprang back to
memory, perhaps not without, to souls of Leacraft’s
fibre, inflicting some stinging stabs of remorse,
when the One Hundred Foot, the One Hundred
and Second Foot, “the Lambs,” the One
Hundred and Third Foot, “the Old Toughs,” the
One Hundred and Fourth Foot, and Seventh, and
Eighth, and Ninth marched past, with ear shattering
dim, in resplendent waves of color, and expressing
the English temperament of reserved
force, and intelligent determination, with, to the
more analytical observer, a suggestion of brutal
power in their sturdy and inelastic tramp.</p>

<p>And then came the people of the Earth, from
the ends of the world they came; the wild, the exotic,
the uncouth, the suave, and treacherous, the
mystic, the benign, the terrible, in all garbs, in
vestures of wool and silk and cotton, in no small
numbers without much vesture. It was a web of
hues, a carpet of figures and dyes, a lithe and sinuous
and portentous living worm, each zone of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
immense length, as it swayed and twisted and
halted, and then slipped on with ludicrous indecision
and disorder, made up of races, ethnic blotches
or flowers from the round prolific globe. The
army had been history, the procession now became
psychological, a review of temperaments, endowments,
climates, proclivities and talents; nay it
wore the aspect of a zoological medley, a vast menagery
of animal products, that with growl and
scream, trumpetings or fluttering wings gave to
the congeries of men and women who walked
among them, or with them, the sentiment and resemblance
of the parade of the beasts before Adam.
As if with England’s dislodgement, the shaken
countries of the earth emptied out their populations
in her wake, disturbed in all their resting
places by her calamity; spilled from their hidden
corners into the shining light of day, and bringing
with them the animals of the fields and the birds of
the air. And the air itself was cruelly brilliant.
The severity of outlines, the sharp shadows, the
nipping frostiness in the shades, where the sun was
not found, told the weary story that England had
lost her climate, and was swept back in a normal
alignment with the cold and feeble countries of the
pole.</p>

<p>What is this odd group accentuated in the midst
of all this confusion of types by a more bizarre
strangeness, the quizzical fatuity and simpering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
idiocy of devotion—grinning <i xml:lang="hi" lang="hi">shikaris</i> from the
Tibet with prayer wheels—from the lofty valleys
of Baltistan and Ladakh, from Kargil and Maulbek
Chamba—incredible children from the East
with their rotating brass wheels, with a woman or
so, proudly walking among them carrying a burden
of wealth in her turquoise and carnelian encrusted
pberak bound around her head and terminating
in a black knotted fringe behind her neck.</p>

<p>And straggling on their tracks come the Malays
from Pinang and Dindings, from Malaca and Singapore,
the small brown men, enduring, brighteyed,
straight black-haired, in jackets, trousers and sarongs—the
tartan skirt fastened around the waist,
and reaching to the knee—and with a raja sprinkled
among them with a yellow umbrella over him,
a dandy nonchalance printing his sleek cheek with
dimples. And India, the nursery of religions, of
dreams, of talking and sleeping and famishing
men, followed, and for an instant Leacraft thought
of Kim’s journey “from Umballa through Kalka
and the Pinjore gardens near by up to Simla,”
which Kipling told; he thought on “the flush of
the morning laid along the distant snows; the
branched cacti; tier upon tier the stony hillsides;
the voices of a thousand water channels; the chatter
of the monkeys, the solemn deodars, climbing
one after another, with down-drooped branches;
the vista of the plains rolled far out beneath them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
the incessant twanging of the tonga horns and the
wild rush of the led horses, the halt for prayers,
the evening conference by the halting places, when
camels and bullocks chewed solemnly together.”</p>

<p>He closed his eyes in a revery, and the next
opened them upon the very thing. Here were the
bullocks, the monkeys, the camels, and here too
came the hulking elephants. Dravidians from the
southern peninsular, in shawls; the Hill tribes, in
coats; the high caste Hindus, in skirts and turbans;
Mussulmen from Cashmere, and a few Indian
Princes, with their suites, in a coruscation of gem
stones, made up a train of spectacles that drew the
eager crowds together, almost to the obliteration of
the narrow string of exotics that, a little shabbily,
shuffled along between them, with however the
Princes on horseback or swung in state in palanquins.</p>

<p>But here came Egypt bearing her witness of the
universality of that power which, with her, at least,
had seemed to play the part of a benevolent trustee
and guide. No longer the impetuous crowds
crushed the line of march; behind the blaring band
that now approached rode Lord Kitchener, Sirdar
of the Egyptian army who had resumed his ancient
post and from an overwrought sentiment for exoneration,
announced his desire to remain there and
thus efface the irreconcileable differences which
had caused Lord Curzon’s retirement from India.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
It was a magnanimous action and had deeply ingratiated
this popular hero in the favor of the nation.
Lord Kitchener, with his staff, preceded, in
military stateliness, and with smart precision, five
regiments or groups of Egyptian soldiers. These
were combined or selected so as to make a bouquet
of colors, but essentially business like also in their
serious regularity, a demeanor fortified to the
point of affectation by the plaudits and unconcealed
admiration of the hosts of people on the streets,
and protruding from every point above them.
There were Arab lancers—in light blue uniforms,
almost too delicate in tone for daily travel, the
bodies of the camel corps, with the blackest type of
men in the Sudanese infantry regiments, assimilating
to the soil of the desert in the color of their
khaki costume, and then other details of the military
organization, gleaming in immaculate white
trousers and coats. It was unmistakably effective,
and it imparted moral strength to this illimitable
advertisement of physical power. It recalled the
campaigns of Khartum and Omdurman, and memorialized
that time-worn boast of the English rehabilitation
of Egypt; a fact certainly, but not to
be distinguished as a very incredible achievement.</p>

<p>The spectacle closed with Zulus and Hottentots,
the bushmen of Australia, some dejected New Zealanders,
and a picturesque assortment of Jamaican
negroes, who tramped along with amusement in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
their staring eyes, and a raggedness of deportment,
reflecting the wasteful and careless way of the
tropics. Nor were there wanting Greeks from Cyprus.
And at the last the loyalty of the Colonies
was splendidly emphasized, Canada, Australia,
South Africa, New Zealand, Natal, Bermuda, the
Bahamas, contributed a final burst of patriotic
zeal, and seemed to open the wide earth, to their
kindred in the English island, for home-making
and re-establishment. Nor was the show of devotion
fortuitous or hollow. It was sincere. It
represented a sudden <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rapprochement</i>, an instantaneous
and valid impulse of sympathy and support.
Nothing had ever happened in the history of the
English people, which had had so vital an influence
in stimulating unity among the English themselves,
which so peremptorily flung them into each other’s
arms, and in a great peril summoned to the surface
the inextinguishable claims of blood, ancestry, tradition,
instincts, and pride, advancing them to a
solidarity never before realised. Its effects were
very apparent. The pictures of Hope, lit up by
the imaginative flamings of Ambition, almost at
times, at this dread moment, gave to the future in
the new habitations awaiting them, an unexpected
salubrity and beauty. The English leaders dreamed
of new achievements, a new literature, a greatness
vastly exceeding all historic records.</p>

<p>Three days after the parade, which Leacraft saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
so magniloquently evolved in the streets of London,
at Tilbury, the King left English soil, to
transplant the symbols and the functions of the English
government to Australia, and to begin the
new experiment. The hills, the fields, the shores,
were all too contracted to hold the army and the
people, gathered in one sublime throb of loyalty
and affection to witness the inexpressible event.
The King wearing the uniform of a Field Marshall
issued from a royal tent and with uncovered
head moved towards the shore where his barge was
moored. The moment was statuesque; the immeasurable
multitude with a wave of heart breaking
emotion uncovered; the national hymn played by
a string and wind orchestra of four hundred pieces
pierced the air with its magnificent undulation of
melody, and a selected chorus led the engulfing tide
of song. Amid the surges of vocal outpouring the
parks of artillery belched their resounding salutes,
the lines of war vessels with their crews at attention
returned the iron throated call, and the King
standing below the sweeping oars, turned for an
instant towards the shore, and then regained his
first posture of immovable fixture upon the
pregnable sides of the Dreadnought, whither each
stroke of those fateful oarsmen was swiftly sending
him.</p>

<p>The suspense was insupportable, the poignant
crushing terror of it all, the incredible predicament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
of a nation bodily leaving its birth place,
stunned the crowds, and in silence with a thousand
varying episodes throughout its interminable acres,
the populace stood, dumb as the unresponsive
rock, apparently as apathetic as the herding cows.</p>

<p>Then at sunfall the Dreadnought, followed by an
escort of cruisers heavily churned the waters, and
passed down the Thames, from its mouth into the
Channel, and so on to the open sea, and with it went
the concentrated expression of the Idea of the English
empire—the King. How strangely immobile
is Nature! A race which had covered its literary
vestures with the garlands of poetry, wrought from
the imagery in nature’s picture-book, which had
spent its brain and industry in winning for nature
new devotees, and new sacrifices of praises and
idolatry, which had enthroned among its chiefest
charms its surrender to the control of nature, in
this hour of torturing doubt, disenthronement and
eviction won no sign of recognition. The day
closed brightly. The sun went down in a sky of
unchecked splendor, and the moon-illuminated
night bathed the ancient bastions of Tilbury with
an argent sheen. The terrible event found no reflection
in the august calmness and serenity of
Nature. “Its withers were unwrung.” Enveloped
in the processes of decay and change, the
lapse of a kingdom was but a paltry contribution to
the chronicle of destroyed continents, and shattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
worlds. There was no contact between its mechanism
and the obliteration of a sentiment, or an idea,
or moral regime. Nothing short of a change in
atmospheric pressure would bring tears to its face,
or agony in its deportment. And what in any case
was this desertion of a land, the removal of a people?
It was subordinated to fluctuations of an
oceanic river, to the up and down shiverings of the
crust of the earth. It was a part of the huge drama
part of the inlaid order of things, as determined at
creation, when the ways and means of shaping the
world, and all things in it, were inaugurated. Why
should the disappearance of a condition shock a
system of disappearances and appearances, which
is another name for the unceasing orbit of revolutions
in the face of the earth, and which is nature?
An individual counts for nothing in the lapse of
twenty-four hours gone or come. Why in the
aeons gone and the aeons yet to come should the
migration of a people, or the emptying of a vestige
of the earth’s surface merit notice? And so the
elements did not hasten to weep, or storm, or furiously
proclaim their commiseration, and the whispering
calls of the half revived summer from pond
and wood and meadow retained their old time
sweetness.</p>

<p>Thus it happened, but from the mouth of men
and women, and prompted deeply in their yearning
soul, rose clouds of prayers that night, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
safety of the King, and ever and anon as troops
marched over the roads in the cold summer night
the hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Lord of the Wave and Deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Save those at Sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their path upon the Ocean keep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">And let them see</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thy hand each passing day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Thy Ministry of Peace.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">was played with bewitching plaintiveness. Men
and women stopped and sang it aloud as the regiments
went by, and sometimes a company of troopers
added with resounding vigor their sonorous
refrain.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister and Mr. Birrell, and Mr.
Asquith, who had been associated in 1906,
in the famous dead lock between the Commons and
the House of Lords over the Educational Bill, prepared
on the departure of the King a statement
which really was a programme of evacuation. It
contemplated a progressive transference of the
people from England, a slowly consummated
shrinkage of the business facilities and the moderated
outflow of capital to the new centres of English
activity. In this way some check would ensue
to the frightful fall in the land values and rentals,
apart from the practical consideration of the physical
impossibility of at once removing forty millions
of people. The government had usurped unusual
powers in the creation of a Committee of
Direction, which by a house to house canvass, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
exhaustive survey of all titles, and a comparative
estimate of the hardship imposed by emigration to
different families, with immense labor, had prepared
an itemized list of departure of the families
of London. This plan had been copied in the large
cities of the kingdom, and a co-operative scheme
framed, which comprised a detailed prescription
of the time of sailing, and the places of settlement
for all persons listed. These lists were commonly
referred to as the “Doomsday Rolls.” The scope
of the committee’s power was comprehensive. It
prohibited to individuals and to societies, federations
and unions, independent action, without explicit
conference with the committee. It proved to
be a most helpful device, and lessened to the lowest
possible percentage of hardship the suffering of the
people.</p>

<p>Leacraft and his new friends freed themselves
from the jurisdiction of the committee, by announcing
their intention to go to America, and upon ample
evidence of their ability to do so, and their independent
financial standing.</p>

<p>It was fully understood that the evacuation was
to be a sustained, gradual movement, with, however,
an irreversible determination to make it finally
complete. It was not believed that England
had become utterly uninhabitable, or that some vestiges
of its former occupation might not be still
maintained. A part of the plan of evacuation involved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
an affectionate care of its greater monuments
of architecture, if possible, though the fierceness
of the winter winds augured unhappily for the
success of this design. A regency of love at any
rate was to be established, and as many links as
possible of connection, sentimental and real, were
to be left unbroken.</p>

<p>And Edinburgh? Thomsen had woefully noted
every day the scanty paragraphs which entered the
papers, and which gave brief intimations of the
devastating and continuous storms, which, through
the winter, swept over Scotland. As if, in order
that the impending changes might be most forcibly
realized, and the loss of time averted from too
leniently interpreting the enormous seasonal metamorphosis
going on, nature had exhausted her
power in developing disaster. Terrific gales had
lashed the rocky coasts, fierce insatiable blizzards
had devouringly raged in the interior, and the pitiless
and untired skies had emptied avalanches of
snow upon the southern counties of Scotland.
Edinburgh became a storm centre. With whirling
inconstancy the storms beat upon the doomed city
from the East and West; buildings were almost
buried in the banked up and superimposed drifts,
crested ranges were in the streets, and palisades of
snow tortured into fantastic shapes, towered over
the outer eminences, fed from the blinding torrents
of flakes driven off from the Pentland hills and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
Salisbury Crags. These summits alone, in the
whitened waste, lifted their scraped crowns to the
thickened skies. Edinburgh had become a city of
the Frost King, and his slumbering legions bivouacked
on and around it, except when aroused to
riotous commotions by the sudden descent of the
whistling armies of the wind.</p>

<p>These details were rather incoherently reported,
as the spring advanced, and an occasional survivor
from the north made his way out of the beleaguered
capital. When the spring had fairly ripened into
summer, an energetic effort was made to reach Edinburgh,
and it succeeded. Scotland at that time
became inundated, and though the enormous accumulations
of snow refused at once to surrender
their blockade, they were so deeply broached and
undermined that the North British line pushed a
train forward to the edge of the city, though unable
to reach its depot in the heart of the city, by reason
of the hammered wedge of snow which it encountered
under the Castle’s cliffs.</p>

<p>After cutting their way out, to the Lothian Road,
the explorers began investigations and were horror
stricken to find that immense conflagration had
broken out, destroying great sections of the city,
which owed its partial survival to the masses of
invading snow. These fires had started in the
houses occupied by the domestic bandits, who had
seized the finest residences, provisioned them from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
the stores, and surrendered themselves to an orgy
of rapine and indulgence, by which their own fears
were stifled, through the excesses of their drunken
dissipation. Hundreds of these unfortunates had
perished in the flames, their recklessness had invoked.
The picture of the noble and beautiful city
was shocking. The fires had made inroads upon
the attractive Princes street, and in the portions
west of the Caledonian station, towards the Donaldson
hospital, gaping openings and swept acres revealed
the unchecked fury of the flames. While it
was probable that the city might, with a return of
auspicious conditions resume some of its old beauty
it was also too plain that the veto of Nature had
been indelibly written across all such plans. Glaciers
had already begun their formation in the
Highlands, and the incipient development of an Ice
Age was forcibly proclaimed on every hand. The
logic of events was unanswerable. The United
Kingdom throughout all its parts must participate
again in the benighted life of Labrador and Siberia.</p>

<p>And Europe throughout its borders felt the poignant
exasperation of the Arctic goad. It trembled
with a new apprehension. The touch of those icy
fingers, stretched out in myriad lines of approach,
swarming like wavering steel points in thick onslaught
from the crowded skies, made it suddenly
anxious. It corrected its habits, it took council of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
piety and played with beseeching care its pretty
role of devotee. Its ridiculous and wicked society,
with futile haste filled the churches, and tried to
forget its inherited cruelty, and even turned with
an unexpected solicitude to the consideration of
improving, in some sure way, the state of the untitled
majority. Its scientific men rushed into congresses
and explored their text books, and read and
reread hopeless papers on the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> of it,
but being unable to invent another Gulf Stream,
retired into dismal prognostications of a returning
Ice Age. In fact deluded, as scientific men often
are, by language, they embraced the thought of a
“returning Ice Cap,” which would successfully
force its way from the Baltic to the Mediterranean.
They nervously began measurements of the Alpine
glaciers, took temperatures, wandered up in the
higher regions of the atmosphere in balloons,
sounded the floor of the ocean, established meteorological
stations everywhere, and became so excited
and convinced that they were happily on hand
at a critical geological juncture, that they succeeded
in supplying a technical ground for panic.</p>

<p>The statesmen and economists were more useful.
They estimated the results of any continued lowering
of the temperatures, the effects of climatic alterations
on life and production, especially in grain,
and found that the southern countries of Europe
were in some danger, and the northern countries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
very really threatened with a commercial overthrow,
as England had been. They too turned to
the colonies of their respective countries for refuge.
It looked as if the bursting receptacles of
European Culture were about to explode and scatter
over the ends of the world the germinal seeds of
its civilization.</p>

<p>“Histories leave oppressive legacies behind
them. They may furnish subjects for art and literature
and poetry, but, as in family inheritance, they
burden posterity with considerable rubbish. Society
does not quickly free itself from superstition,
nor from its habits of thinking or of doing things.
Even when they become anachronisms we are
loathe to part from them, because, to our own detriment,
we are fond of them. America has started
fresh, and runs on the road of opportunity, while
other nations must hobble and limp as best they
can, with the clogs of old usage and prejudice hanging
on their feet.”</p>

<p>It was the voice of our friend Leacraft, and he
was standing on a broad piazza built at the rear of
a spacious villa on the topmost slopes of Staten Island,
in the harbor of New York city, looking at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
motionless ocean far beyond the fringe of land immediately
before him, flushed by the setting sun.
That luminary with glorious opulence had painted
the sky a seething carmine in the west, and imparted
its most delicate reminders of the morn to the
eastern arches of the heavens, that hung above the
sea. The picture was superbly satisfying. There
was enough detail in the landscape, enough isolation
of house and wood and field, of moor and
strand, and not too much. The oncoming twilight
softly blended these nearer things, yet left them
palpable. But the day still flung its garlands of illumination
over the broad skies; and the sensitive
surfaces of the water with lavish sympathy repeated
on its face the smiles of the blending zenith. And
on either side of Leacraft stood Miss Tobit and Mr.
Thomsen, and the month was June, and the year,
narrated.</p>

<p>Before we satisfy our curiosity more closely as
to their relation, or note those changes which five
years, however kindly inclined, must leave behind
them, let us follow this conversation which of itself
1915, five years after all the happenings previously
may unroll some curtains of the past.</p>

<p>“Well,” it was Thomsen who was now speaking,
“then I suppose you are not willing to quarrel with
the material revolution we have been through, because
all that has come between the present and the
past, like the sundering of Damocles’ sword, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
saved us from the necessity of denuding ourselves
of the old things, turning us loose in a fresh field,
where we may play high jinks with all we once venerated,
and where we may end by despising ourselves,
for the very liberties you seem anxious for
us to indulge in.”</p>

<p>Leacraft motioned to the chairs, and the three sat
down, in the same order as they stood. The place
obviously was Leacraft’s, or he exercised some sort
of control over it. And it was Miss Tobit’s voice
which next took up the thread of talk—it was noticeable
that Leacraft turned eagerly and looked at
her, though his earnest face betrayed no symptoms
of possession, in truth, a contemplative sadness for
a moment rested on his features, vanishing even
with its dawn.</p>

<p>“Why give up old things? Why change and
change and change? You call it progress. Is it
anything but going around in a circle? You will
come back to the very things you now reject, and
some centuries hence the world will try the old experiments
of Feudlism and Chivalry; and Kings
by Divine Right will be as popular as elected Presidents—indeed,
people may care some day as much
as ever to say their prayers and go to church.”</p>

<p>Both Leacraft and Thomsen laughed, but it was
Leacraft who retorted, and he leaned far back in
the Morris chair, his eyes bent upon the visionary
ring of the horizon now webbed with bluescent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
shades.</p>

<p>“I think there will be no returns, Mrs. Thomsen”—Ah!
then Leacraft had lost again—“no
Merry-go-round; our path, the path of humanity, is
on and on and on, not always straight, not always
level, and never final in its destinations. It was a
physical chasm that separated the first colonies of
this land from Europe. They brought with them
traditions, customs, though luckily not of a very
silly sort—but the lack of continuity with the whole
antecedent history of England practically destroyed
that history for them, and they began in untrammelled
freedom to think for themselves and determine
the essence of manhood, of worth, of liberty,
of faith, of brotherhood, and their thinking throve
upon nothing so much as the contemplation of the
as yet, humanly speaking, unused world about
them.</p>

<p>“And the vicissitudes of living, the peril, the undiminished
levy made by necessity upon their inventiveness,
their industry, their courage, expelled
the remaining vestiges of fealty to humbug, the
pretense of class, the arrogance of office. They had
wrested a living from Nature, under circumstances
of unabashed familiarity with the cruelty of the
savage, the obduracy of climate, and the grudging
responses of a sterile soil, and they estimated
worth by the hardihood of men who worked.</p>

<p>“An American essayist has pointed out the emphasis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
laid by the northern, the Teutonic races,
upon individual liberty. He says something like
this: The Germanic race has been distinguished
at all ages for its political capacity, and the possession
of vigorous institutions of self-government;
that there grew up among the nations of this race
a well ordered system of government, based upon
the right of the individual. And why was this?
Because they knew of the hardships of living, and
the fibre of liberty-loving natures were formed under
the kneading strains of perpetual conflict.
James McKinnon has pointed out the same thing in
his History of Modern Liberty.</p>

<p>“Arbitrary and selfish rule was most quickly
crushed in Central Europe. No! we shall not return
to the old follies, because we shall not be permitted
to return; because struggle with Nature
will never cease.”</p>

<p>“Russia has been a cold country,” answered
Thomsen; “and if the gauge of liberty is coldness,
we should expect to have seen the fruits of popular
government ripening, if you will permit the paradox,
in its zero atmospheres; or if wildness and
natural enemies—those that make housekeeping difficult,
and a man’s skin a precious abode for his
soul—why have not the negroes of Africa won
over the images of rhetoric which have been wasted
upon Greece and Rome—both, by-the-by, hot countries?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<p>“Rome and Greece never knew what Liberty was
in the modern sense. Both were types of class government.
Before Christianity, there could be no
ideal of freedom in its holiest meanings. As for
Russia, the germs of liberty are yet buried there,
but it is understood; an accident has put the autocracy
in power, and like all beneficiaries of a system,
its members fight for their living; besides,
Russia has not left off its barbarism. But nothing
under Heaven will keep her from being free. As
to the negro, he lies too far back, too near to the
origins, and, in any case, the dangers of the jungle
are met by craft, rather than by consecutive exertion
and daring.”</p>

<p>“You regret that our new growth in the Pacific—the
Australian England—has not put on the features
of a republic, instead of preserving the heritage
of the kingly and royal class institutions under
which the old England flourished. Do you
think that nations can safely try experiments, like
children playing games, or chemists mixing solutions,
which, in the latter case, may at any moment
blow their heads off? I think not.”</p>

<p>“I think,” Leacraft slowly replied, while Agnes
Ethel Tobit—she who had become inferentially
the wife of the handsome Thomsen—arose and,
walking to her husband’s side, leaned over the back
of his chair, thus looking down upon the speaker,
who had turned towards Thomsen, as if her movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
was dictated by a desire to hear his friend
more distinctly; “I think that the finest, the most
inspiring—yes, the most delicate and subtle virtues
flourish in a republic, such as this Republic of the
United States is. I confess, I am in love with it; I
love its people. They are superbly human, and
humanly noble. The American gentleman, and he
lives on no particular and restricted level—you
find him among the firemen, the policemen, the
clerks, the fathers of families—this unique man is
always gracious, delightful, unerringly just. I believe
that these traits develop most naturally under
the dispensations of equality, reasonably understood.
I think the most fruitful national life ensues,
when a nation stands fundamentally, in its
government, and in its social conceptions, for common
sense standards, and an unqualified acceptance
of the principles of personal freedom. I like these
Americans. To me, their ardor, their naturalness,
their hearty friendship, their generous self-forgetfulness,
and a certain deferential amusement at the
foibles of less emancipated cultures, is fascinating.
Of course, there are stupid rich Americans,
dressed in most obnoxious livery of affectation and
imitation, men and women who have treacherous
tendencies in their feelings and desires, willing
always to kick their own country, and willing to
leave it, but never willing to relinquish the luxuries
its prosperity has enabled them to enjoy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
There are also hateful middle-class Americans, who
deteriorate the impressions made by the best aspects
of the American heart and mind; but the substance
and the spirit of the American life, however
much disguised, or, from momentary and economic
reasons obscured, is to me the most palatable; it is
palpably the best life now shown on the world; it
is the most energizing, the most alert, and it carries
the power of enormous assimilation, because it
is built on the essence of manhood, the respect for
the rights of others. I know what is in your
thoughts and on the point of your tongue. You
would ask: How about the Chinaman, the Negro,
and the Japanese, perhaps? That is a long question,
and has nothing to do with my contention, for
in a nutshell, respect for others’ rights does not involve
respect for others’ habits, and generous as
the Americans are, they are not so stupid as to wish
to imperil, for an unnecessary sentiment, the hard-gained
benefits of their own national experiment.
They have already leavened the whole earth; it’s
not to be expected that they digest all of its rubbish
as well. Let the rest of the world do something for
itself, and clean its own social sloughs, by a little
more admixture of freedom and sympathy.</p>

<p>“All this may seem to you intensely disagreeable,
perhaps a little disloyal, but you wrong me. If I
might answer your question without more evasion.
I would peremptorily declare that I hoped that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
new England in Australia would put on the lineaments,
nay, incorporate the very breath and body
of this land. I know it has not; possibly it could
not; possibly pernicious and selfish instrumentalities
have made it impossible. Pardon my intractable
enthusiasm, but do not mistrust my heart. It
is always England’s. The night is too calm, too
beautiful, to disgrace it with wrangling. Let us
tell the story of the last years to each other. Mine
is a short one, and can come last; but yours? Ah!
well I know some of it,” and Leacraft, without constraint
or any show of vacillating envy, smiled up in
the face of the pretty woman who looked down
at him, and deeply that woman’s heart honored him
for his magnanimous courage.</p>

<p>There was a pause for an instant, and then Thomsen
began. He rose from his chair, and walking to
the railing of the piazza, sat on it, half turned to
the paling East, half towards Leacraft, and told the
story of the transplanted English nation.</p>

<p>That story can be told in more exacting phraseology
than the colloquial method permits, and until
his narrative becomes more personal, let us authentically
review the events he rehearsed, which form a
unique historic episode.</p>

<p>With the departure of the King from the shores
of England, the actual evacuation of the island began,
and the means and ways of transferring the
people previously thought out, were carefully applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p>The
moment the King and Parliament arrived in
Australia, a predicament arose. The King was recognized
as king, functional in Australia and in
England, functional anywhere the English control
was established; but the Parliament of England,
as the highest law-giving legislature of the realm,
did it supersede the regional legislation of Australia?
Was the autonomic power of the provinces
of Australia obliterated with the arrival of the supreme
legislative body of the British Empire?
There was one broad, obvious proposition. The
remedy to all doubt, collision, and ambiguity was
to resume in Australia the exact conditions which
had vanished in England, and now naturally sought
a restatement and erection in the land the King
and Parliament had reached. And this was generally
accepted. There was a cordial and almost precipitate
display of adhesion to the new plan. It
destroyed the independent existence of the various
sections of Australia, and made the continental
island a unit under the control of the Parliament,
just as England had been. The enthusiasm
which greeted this solution was adequate and convincing.
It gave renewed hope to the patriotic and
loyal souls who prayed and worked for the re-production
of the England they had left. The King
himself responded to this burst of practical allegiance
with a wise and fervent expression of affection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
and thankfulness. It was a gem of deliberate
composition, and was well received. Meetings of
endorsement and proclamations of ratification were
made everywhere, and in the tumult of acclamation
it escaped notice that a formidable opposition had
become organized for a forcible resistance to the
whole scheme. This was over-awed or suppressed,
not without a show of force, in which Thomsen had
been himself engaged, and which brought about
some adventures around the region at Mount Harwick,
in New South Wales.</p>

<p>Thomsen, after the conclusion had been reached
that his own and Miss Tobit’s families should follow
the stream of people going to Australia, rather,
than was at first intended, to coincide with Leacraft’s
wishes for them all to visit America, had
sought employment in the Government’s service,
among those to whom had been entrusted the regulation
of this colossal emigration. He was therefore
well acquainted with its various phases and results.</p>

<p>When the King and the Parliament left England,
over two millions had preceded them, being
naturally, those who accepted the situation, and
who, besides, were not specifically limited for their
support to investments at home. They went everywhere,
many to the continent, many to India, perhaps
half to America, which grew more and more,
before the eyes of the people, as the most natural,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
most desirable, the most friendly home. A large
number strayed to Africa, and yet others sought
the expanding possibilities of South America.
Englishmen had acquired such extended interests,
drew so largely upon the resources of the entire
world for their support, that now in a way they
found natural business refuges all over its varied
surface. It was a happy consequence of the constraining
littleness of their own island.</p>

<p>The financial question was the real difficulty,
apart from the harsh bereavement and hardship of
the divorce from all their previous living and associations.
It was solved, at least partially, by the
Government issuing paper money, similar to the
greenbacks, which carried the United States
through the Civil War. These were furnished to
applicants upon deposit of sworn, approved and
examined statements of their property of all kinds
in England. Twenty-five per cent of the amount
thus appearing was given, or rather loaned, to the
applicant, and with this he was enabled to make a
start in the new quarters he had selected. The
plan involved the assumption of an enormous burden
by the Government, and an unqualified confidence
in it by the people.</p>

<p>Of course, England was not in any sense to become
a depopulated island. Its real estate values,
though shrunk to slender fractions of their former
worth, would yet have some value, and whereas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
in the case of a manufacturer, the Government
made the loan upon his attested resources in machinery
and certified correspondence, the risk was
reduced sensibly within discoverable limits. Loss,
agitation, dislocations, in many cases ruin, resulted,
but the transfer of the manufacturing plants
was made most skilfully, and before the factories
in England were closed, the same products were being
produced in Australia. The menace of the
emergency had startled Englishmen into a really
reasonable and adequate show of sense, quickness
and resource; usually poor business men, torpid
and conservative, shackled with a kind of mild and
traditional laziness, they became, under the stimulation
of the danger of extinction, active and wary,
and intensive.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the climatic changes continued,
and the face of the United Kingdom more and more
altered under the infliction of the long and tempestuous
winters, the cool, shortened summers, and
the ice blockade about its coasts. For it had early
become apparent that in some inexplicable way,
the Arctic currents streamed down from the polar
regions with reinforced volume and velocity, bringing
with them the discharged masses of ice projected
from their usual course westward, by the
irruption into the Arctic Ocean through Behring
Straits of the united oceanic rivers of the Gulf
Stream and the currents from the Yellow Sea.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
Throughout the spring, the beleaguered coasts were
deeply fringed with ice-floes and icebergs, whose
chilling emanations created fogs, and wrapt the islands
in cheerless cold. Each passing year had
made more clear the surpassing wisdom of the
evacuation. But a large population found that they
could support themselves on the island, made up
of the hardy, enduring types, the sailors, fishermen,
and the boreal agriculturists—the farmer who entertains
life successfully where the earth reluctantly
yields her products, and the scant nature furnishes
but few of the products of the soil. For now
a most extraordinary thing happened. The refrigeration
of Northern Europe had driven down towards
the south the northern denizens. They eagerly
seized the deserted land of the southerners, less
accustomed to the niggardly responses of the field,
and met the attacks of the climate with the accustomed
patience and resistance to which they had
become innured in their northern home. In this
way the population of Iceland almost bodily left
the bleak and ice-bound coasts of the Arctic island,
that no longer offered the meagre semblance
even of subsistence, which previously maintained
its stubbornly hardy occupants. Nothing could
have been more fortunate, as it retarded in some
measure the shocking decline in the values of the
land, and gave to all establishments that might
otherwise have been turned into homes for owls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
and foxes a partial usefulness. Not indeed that the
manufacturing interests would be considerably revived,
but warehouses and buildings connected with
manufacturing or shipping business would be made
into storehouses, and the castles and large manor
houses were converted into curious communal colonies,
where those boreal people most joyfully repaired
and developed profitable communities.</p>

<p>Large numbers of the very poor found in the
exodus of the well paid or employed classes above
them, a grand chance to renew their own luck.
They became keepers of the deserted buildings;
they fraternized with the newcomers, and freed
from the incubus of a superimposed social repression,
became happy and industrious.</p>

<p>To all the brands and grades of the surviving
or deserted inhabitants came increasing numbers
of Scandinavians; important fractions of the
Scotch settled on the coasts of England, and even
immigrants from Newfoundland and Canada were
tempted to seize the strange opportunity to occupy
vast and abandoned cities, which furnished them
in many instances with palatial shelters, but which
later became repellant and unpleasant abodes, from
which they too willingly withdrew to the smaller
settlements.</p>

<p>The tragedy of the big cities was complete. They
were melancholy wastes, their empty streets seemed
baleful and dismal. They gave ghostly thrills of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
terror, even in the noon-day, to the passers by—silent
graves of past memories—the speechless,
vacant, staring windows in the unlit rooms were
like the open but expressionless eyes of corpses,
and the awful fall of silence through the labyrinth
of ways, roads, lanes, places, squares, alleys, descended
upon the wanderer, caught by some malign
trick of adventure within their voiceless, motionless
depths, with the benumbing touch of the grave.
He hastened his steps; he ran to escape the deadly
stupor, the inexpressible gloom of loneliness, where
every aspect betokened life. The solitude of nature
inspires, draws to the lips an involuntary
prayer, or places in the heart the movements of
hope, but this hideous contradiction of signs and
effect weighed like lead upon the spirit, and forced
from the shrinking heart the ejaculations of despair.</p>

<p>Never on earth was there such a picture of dejected
grandeur, as this emptied metropolis of the
world presented; never before had a great city
become its own tomb, through the flight of its inhabitants;
never in any record of disaster, whether
by earthquake, pestilence, flood or vulcanism, was
there such obliteration as followed the withdrawal
of the citizens of London from their own capital.</p>

<p>The thick blanket of the snow was thrown over
it in winter, and its emergent domes, pinnacles, obelisks
and needles offered a fantastic similitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
to mortuary monuments, or else beneath the yellow
moon its piercing whiteness, like a titanic face
of someone killed, smote the blue black skies above
it with remorse.</p>

<p>But in Australia the English strength revived
and broadened; it promised to make a gigantic
social revolution; it worked strangely enough in
unison with the newly awakened hopes of the King
to restore an accustomed prestige to the Crown.
This political phenomenon attracted the attention
of the civilized world. The King in a most adroit
proclamation to the people had peculiarly enlisted
their sympathy by his veiled complaint of the habitual
loss of power, and the encroachments upon
the kingly prerogatives of the self-constituted Cabinet
of Ministers. The King’s action was always
tacitly prescribed and anticipated. He was a puppet,
dressed in regalia, with no shadow of power,
real and personal. And this he resented, but his
language was the sentences of diplomacy, and lost
the individual note entirely in a concerned and
measured argument, restrained by every possible
regard for the present custom, urging a greater
confidence in the King’s wishes, and a larger precinct
of action for his judgment. This momentous
promulgation was contemptuously referred to by
its critics as “the Ourselves” letter, but it met a
favorable reception and it enlisted the cordial endorsement
of the House of Lords, nor was it altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
resented by the House of Commons. The
achievement of this success led the King into a further
step of interference, in the appointments and
in the personnel of the Cabinet, and he succeeded
further in impressing his wishes upon a number of
important bills passing through the Parliament. In
short, by a persistent pressure, seconded by friends
among the people, and a growing following in the
legislature, he had inserted his views, and extorted
from the grudging concessions of the Commons’
recognition of the royal prerogatives. He had
shown himself unusually active in resource, in
suggestions, and in intercourse with the people. His
examples had been followed with enthusiasm by the
nobility, who, so to speak, spread themselves before
the observation of the nation, and exerted an
unaccustomed generosity and ubiquitous energy in
practically assisting the work of rehabilitation. At
a general election, many candidates were discussed
and elected upon this issue, viz.: the restoration to
the King of kingly power.</p>

<p>“And so, you see,” Thomsen concluded, “the
unexpected happens, as it always does. We moved
to an ultra-democratic <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">milieu</i>, a veritable nest of
fads and socialistic temerities and experiments,
and lo! the reaction sets in, and in Australia the
King may recover the power, lost with the Stuarts,
and the monarchial principle gets a shove ahead,
which, with prosperity, and in England, no impulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
short of the fiat of the Almighty, could have
secured for it. A prophet who would have foretold
that, would have scored a poor success in 1900 as a
state maker.”</p>

<p>Before he had finished speaking, Leacraft had
left his chair, and was walking to and fro near the
speaker—and then he advanced to the edge of the
few steps that led from the piazza to the open
swards beneath them, which were fringed by an
emergent crown of trees growing thickly in some
lower crease or hollow of the ground, beyond which
again the eye fell to the foot swells, and the undulations
of land far off, in the flats, just beginning to
twinkle with lights.</p>

<p>Leacraft spoke slowly, his eyes still fixed upon
the distance, as if in revery, but his measured words
came clearly to his two friends, carried by a voice
which, always melodious and cultured, now gained
a sort of passionate yearning, and then again was
approved as disinterestedly clean and judicial:
“All this is an episode. Nothing more. The future
of the races of the world means the widening
scope of the Republican idea. There can be no other.
Education forbids its extinction. Yes, and Authority
endorses it. This sudden foolishness in Australia
will only invoke a perilous reaction. There
can be to-day in governmental systems only varied
applications of the one thought; the rule of the people
through an appeal to the people’s choice of rulers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
It is fundamentally common sense in an era
of enlightenment, to begin with; but since the United
States have eclipsed all nations, and raised the
standards of individual action beyond all previous
estimates, this conclusion has coercively been accepted,
that through the influences propagated under
this popular freedom of control, the finest, the
richest, the sweetest, the most magnanimous types
of character are also engendered and completed. A
kind of psychological logic is involved. A vast
psychic power of selection sets in, and irrevocably
the most noble, the most disenthralled natures
slowly appear. In comparison with their best results,
the representatives of other cultures appear
dwindling and abortive. And why? Because in
the least limited field of opportunity the unrestrained
power of nature to make character must
of necessity evolve consummate and supreme examples.
Nothing is more demonstrable. It must be
conceded, I grant, that at first the crop of temperaments
is marked more by rash hardihood,
strident vulgarities, and climbing audacity, but
these very qualities, which in the naming seem so
distasteful, mature naturally, in later generations,
into devoted courage, æsthetic spontaneity; juices
of the fruit when green form the basis of its later
richness.</p>

<p>“I know the tiresome and hackneyed nonsense,
and the mean-spirited sneers of the European at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
American, for his lack of culture, his defect in
polish, his money-getting haste. And it’s all a
lie!” Leacraft wheeled round as if on a pivot,
and even in the pale light the Thomsens could see
that his face flushed, and the stern decision of his
voice betrayed the fires of resentment. “Who is
it that these precious pretenders of Europe look
to when they have famine and disaster; who has
taught the lessons of sympathy, of open-hearted
helpfulness, and unswerving generosity, or made
them recognize in their own natures the almost exterminated
seeds of kindness? As to culture, let
me tell you in all seriousness that the idle glamour
of a scholar’s diction does not weigh a barleycorn
as against the flashing splendor of an honest and
sincere spirit; as to polish, who made the European
regard Woman as something better than the helpless
ally of his lust, and the chained companion to
his exultant vanity? Woman has gained a new
empire of dignity in these new lands; she for once
triumphs in the unquenched assertion of her rights.
As to money-making greed, where under the canopy
will you find a more meanly mercenary race
than these same Europeans, inert panderers to
pleasure for money, fortune hunters, and silent
spectators of atrocities, if the risk of money loss
stops their way to succor. I know the dolts and
traitors on the American soil, the men and women
who sell their birthright for the mess of pottage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
contained in a gilded name in Europe, or the hollow
mockery of a coat-of-arms. These are the tattooed
children of humbug—careless and ungrateful, indolent
and self-seeking, lured by that strange beauty
which Europe, for some inscrutable reason,
seems to keep, and of which even I, an Englishman,
feel jealous, for the sake of a country which may
not be so good-looking, but which becomes every
day more sublimely the appointed pattern of the
future state. Well! my friends, you must pardon
these ‘wild and whirling words.’ They may strike
you as an unseemly tirade, but if you knew this land
as well as I do, you, too, might trespass beyond the
limits of moderation in its defense. But other matters
have for you a less doubtful interest. The
great physical revolution which has left its mark
no less in the political world than in the material,
has become consolidated and solidified into a permanent
feature of the earth. The broad engulfment
of the land at the isthmus has established an
open way to the Pacific from the Atlantic, and
the initial formation of the barrier northward
from the Caribbean Sea by the erection of a ridge
from Cuba to Yucatan, and partially from Jamaica
to Honduras, this latter connexion the singular sequel
to the disturbance which overwhelmed Kingston
in 1907, has advanced far enough to effectually
assist the momentous deflection of the Gulf Stream
from the Atlantic. And another transformation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
has thereby been achieved. The alien mass of hot
water pouring into the Pacific at the isthmus, when
no longer propelled by the easterly winds, resumes
its original impetus of rotary direction, and
streams, sweeping northward, along the coasts of
California, Oregon and Washington, bringing in
its further extension warmth to British America
and Alaska. By this amelioration of its climate,
Alaska has specially profited. Its numerous mineral
resources have been more exhaustively explored,
and the wealth of its boundless areas promises
returns beyond the wildest dreams of avarice.</p>

<p>“The convulsions which were so dismally foretold,
in the social and political fabric of this country,
never occurred. They were quite lost sight of
in the wonderful happenings of the world, and the
trite aphorism that the spirit of discontent is best
overcome by an appeal to the spirit of curiosity,
obtained an almost ludicrous illustration in the subsidence
of every murmur of schism and contention,
as the amazement grew over the upset of the temporalities
of the world, as the earth readjusted its
members for another, let us hope, long and uneventful
slumber.</p>

<p>“For myself, perhaps I should deprecate your
censure by an apology. It is true, I did not follow
the fortunes of my country, though with my mind
I ardently canvassed and considered them. The
very interests which brought me to this land were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
English, and my superintendence and success with
them, has in a few ways made the survival of not a
few Englishmen possible at this crisis. Really, my
best place of helpfulness was here. Jim has been
with me, and has proved invaluable, and that poor
woman, whom I told you about meeting in Victoria
Park, the night before we saw the great procession
of evacuation, was found by me, and now
Jim is her husband. There’s nothing shocking
about it. Her first husband died of consumption.
It was a foregone conclusion. Jim showed himself
a big-hearted friend, and the girl learned to
think the world of him. And when she was alone,
what could have been better from any point of view
than that she should have married him?</p>

<p>“And for me, Mrs. Thomsen, there is peace, too.”
Leacraft moved to the doorway of the broad hall
that divided the spacious house. He pushed it open,
and as the light from the interior fell upon his face,
the visitors saw the smile of an abiding happiness
upon the thoughtful countenance, and Agnes Ethel
Thomsen utter a prayer of thankfulness that <em>he</em> had
found contentment.</p>
